Jeremy Corbyn that NATO bashing Trident strapping would be a polisher of the British Army he says he still admires Bolivarian revolutionary socialism.  I say he's gratis

Boris:

Right now our best single defence against Omicron is to get vaccinated and to get boosted.  If you’re boosted your immune response will be stronger.  Yesterday, in addition to offering a second dose to all twelve to fifteen year olds, the independent JCVI recommended that boosters should now be offered to everyone over 18 and that we halve the minimum gap between a second dose and a booster from six months to three months.  That means that over 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone.  I am here today with the health secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard chief executive of NHS England to set out our plan to make this happen. 
The target that we’ve set ourselves is to offer a booster to everyone eligible by the end of January.  As with the first jabs, we’ll be working through people by age group, going down in five year bands because it’s vital that the older and the more clinically vulnerable get that added protection first.  Even if you’ve had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don’t book until the NHS says it’s your turn.  We’ve already done almost eighteen million boosters across the UK, but we’ve got millions more to do to protect the most vulnerable.  Then we’ll move down the cohorts rapidly and working together with the Department of Administrations, we want to ramp up capacity across the whole United Kingdom to the levels we achieved in the previous vaccination effort. 
We’re going to be throwing everything at it in order to ensure that everyone eligible is offered that booster in, as I say, just over two months.  Across England we’ll have more than one thousand five hundred community pharmacy sites, vaccinating people near where you live.  All of our sites will increase their capacity and will stand up extra hospital hubs on top of those already active.  There’ll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees and will deploy at least four hundred military personnel to assist the efforts of our NHS, alongside of course, the fantastic jabs army of volunteers. 
I know the frustration that we all feel with this Omicron variant, the sense of exhaustion that we could be going through all this all over again, but today I want to stress this.  Today, that’s the wrong thing to feel because today our position is and always will be immeasurably better than it was a year ago.  What we’re doing is taking some proportionate precautionary measures while our scientists crack the Omicron code and while we get the added protection of those boosters into the arms of those who need them most.  We’re going to get behind the men and women of our NHS who’ve saved so many lives on the frontline and run our vaccination program for a year, almost without a break as they have and who are going back into the breach yet again.  I want to say on behalf of the entire country, a thank you to each and every one of them for their extraordinary efforts.  The best way we can all show our gratitude is by doing our bit and stepping forward when our time comes to get that booster. 
I’ve been waiting patiently for my moment to come.  It’s happening on Thursday, I’m pleased to say.  Whenever your turn comes, get your booster and ask your friends and your family to do the same.  It’s time for another great British vaccination effort.  We’ve done it before and we’re going to do it again and let’s not give this virus a second chance.  Thank you very much.  

Boris:

Well, Alex, thank you very much for that and that’s a question that’s been asked a lot in the why aren’t we doing face coverings all over the place? And the answer is that we’re trying to take a balanced and a proportionate approach, Alex, slowing down the spread of, of Omicron while we get to the bottom of the exact effect that it has.  But, Sajid, do you want to add on that?

Boris:

Tanith from Surrey asks, “Given the concerns of the Omicron variant being more highly transmissible and possibly bypassing the vaccines, what is the government doing to protect those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable, especially in those who are immunosuppressed in which the current vaccines do not have the same efficacy, as in say, a normal, healthy person who is not immunocompromised?” Saj, I think you touched on that earlier on. 

Boris:

Thanks very much, Vicky.  So the answer is no, the guidance remains the same and we’re trying to take a balanced and proportionate approach and as I explained on Saturday when talking for the first time to everybody about Omicron, we’re really dealing with two variants at the same time.  We’ve got the measures in place to fight Delta, which we think are appropriate and then we’re bringing in some tougher measures to stop the seeding. Then we’re bringing in some tougher measures to stop the seeding, the rapid seeding of Omicron in this country, to give us the time we need to get the boosters in and of course, to find out more.  Those measures, as you know, are the tough measures.  The borders, the PCR test.  When you arrive, quarantine until you’ve got a negative result, then tougher measures on masks, and then making sure that contact for anybody who comes into contact with an Omicron case also has to quarantine.  We think that’s the right balance and we will keep it of course, under constant review. 

Boris:

I should say, of course, we’ve got tougher measures, even tougher measures for travel for those countries, for those 10 countries, that seem to have particular problems with Omicron.  Is that it? I think that was it.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  Sorry. 

Boris:

Well, first of all, the guidance remains the same.  That doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t take sensible precautions and everybody should continue for instance, to wash your hands and make sure that you have good ventilation and wear a mask when you are in a confined space with people you don’t normally meet.  What we’re doing is we’re toughening up the regulations in a specific ways that I’ve outlined to deal with Omicron and I think that’s the right approach.  We’re taking a balanced under and a proportionate approach.  But as I said, I think on Saturday, the most important thing is we still think that your best single of protection against all variances to get the booster and I’m still confident that this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas and that remains my view forty eight hours later. 

Boris:

Thank you.  I think Amanda, your first. 

Boris:

And Ben, on your question, the crucial thing, the $64 million question, or billion dollar question, whatever is, does this new variant beat the vaccines and does it beat… Particularly, does it beat the booster? As I’ve said over the last few days, we think that the chances are that the boosters will continue to give you protection against every variant, protection of some degree.  That’s why it’s so absolutely vital to get the boosters but we need to check that.  We can’t… This is what we think, but we need to check that and that’s why we’re waiting to see what the science tells us.  What I can certainly tell you is that the measures that we’ve put in place will not last a minute more than we think they are strictly necessary for the protection of public health. 

Boris:

Thank you.  Yes, and Jason, just on your point about Christmas parties and Nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.  And we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in school, as I’ve said many times throughout this pandemic.  What we’re doing is trying to take a balanced and proportionate approach to the particular risk that seems to be posed by Omicron, or certainly is posed by Omicron, are focused in particular on measures at the borders.  And we think that’s the right way to go for the time being, until we know more and until we can get more boosters, as we’ve been saying, into people’s arms.  Can we go to Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe of the FT, please?

Boris:

Oh, sorry.  Thanks, Jasmine.  We haven’t ruled out anything.  I’ve got to tell you, I think another lockdown of the kind that we’ve had before is extremely unlikely.  I’ll be up front with you about that, but we keep everything under constant review.  In our fight against the Delta variant, we think that it’s basically been going our way or going the way that we planned.  Although cases remain high or high-ish, you are seeing a decline in the numbers of admissions to hospital and a decline in the number of deaths.  And that’s the crucial thing that we’ve been following.  So at the moment, we see no cause to move to plan B.  But as I’ve said to you many, many times before, we’ve got to keep that under review.  But the measures we’re talking about to deal with Omicron are, as I’ve said, distinct. 

Boris:

Thanks, Joe.  So on your point about working from home, this is not something that we think currently is necessary for the reasons I gave to Jasmine.  We’ve got a package of measures that we have in place to deal with the Delta variant, and that’s principally been rolling out the vaccine and it’s been working.  And I repeat what I said just now about the numbers of deaths and hospitalisations coming down.  We now have a particular issue to deal with the potential seeding of the new Omicron variant.  And there, what we want to do is focus particularly on tough measures at the borders.  We’re also doing something to stop transmission by reintroducing face masks in some settings.  So continuing to advise them in other settings, but tightening the rules on face masks.  And the reason for not proceeding with plan B is we want to take an approach that is proportionate and balanced and suits the needs of the present risk.  Of course, we will change things as necessary, but what we’re looking for is the first real reassurance that we need that the vaccines are efficacious against this variant.  Even if the effectiveness is reduced, it’s still very important to know whether they’re effective or not.  And in particular, we need to know quite how effective the boosters are.  As I’ve said, we think there are good grounds for believing that the boosters will give you, under all circumstances, the protection that you need, considerable protection.  

Boris:

That’s why the most important thing for everybody to do is go out and get your booster.  And that’s the number one thing that people need to be doing.  Thank you all very much.  Listen, I just want to say something, because nobody’s asked about it so far.  I just want to say something about Storm Arwen and its effect on the north of the country.  And I just want to say how I’m extremely sympathetic to everybody who’s suffered these power outages and it must be appalling.  I think a million homes lost their electricity.  950,000 have seen that electricity now restored.  But clearly, for 50,000 people, that is not good enough.  And I want to reassure everybody that we’re working as hard as we can to get power back to those homes.  All I can say is the gusts were going at 100 miles an hour, and talking to the people who operate the grid, they say that there was nothing that they could do about it.  But we are doing everything we can to restore power, talking to Northern Power grid and everybody else to get that fixed.  And I appreciate it.  It must be a very, very tough time for those homes that are currently without power.  And I’m afraid that is all we have time for.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you. 

Boris:

Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much dear Ursula.  And thank you everybody.  Thanks Joe and Ursula for hosting this meeting, and you’re absolutely right that we began this idea with the Build Better Partnership in Carbis Bay.  To keep 1. 5 degrees in sight to reach global net-zero and to protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of climate change means the development of new clean and green infrastructure.  And this presents a huge opportunity to turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission as President Biden has said for jobs and growth.  In the UK, through our net-zero strategy, we are pioneering a green industrial revolution with public investment, leveraging billions of pounds of private funding into whole new industries from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage, allowing us in the UK to level up our whole country with thousands of good new green jobs, and by partnering with developing and emerging economies to invest in climate-smart infrastructure and meeting our $100 billion climate finance commitment.  

Boris:

Of course, we can go on to unlock trillions, whether it’s tens of trillions or hundreds of trillions, as Mark Carney would say, of private finance to do something similar around the whole world.  So our pursuit of global net-zero can drive global levelling up, helping developing economies fast track their way to a more prosperous, clean and green future.  So the UK wholeheartedly supports the principles that President Biden has set out, working in partnership to create the highest standards of climate-resilient infrastructure rooted in our shared democratic values of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, and led by the host countries, responding to their needs.  And I welcome the work of Mark Carney and others on creating what we call country platforms help connect the pipelines of green infrastructure projects with the vast private capital looking to invest in net-zero.  The UK is proud to contribute to these efforts today with our Clean Green Initiative, as you say, Ursula, by taking our green industrial revolution global, we’re investing over 3 billion pounds and mobilising a similar amount of private finance to support technologies like drought-resistant agriculture, where investors have been reluctant to take the risks alone.  We’re investing in green bonds for renewable energy in Vietnam, and solar power in Burkina Faso, Pakistan, Nepal, and Czech.  

Boris:

We’re offering guarantees to The World Bank and The African Development Bank to unlock up to 2. 2 billion pounds of new finance for green infrastructure across India and Africa.  And we’re working with President Ramaphosa, Cyril Ramaphosa, to deliver his ambitious vision for faster greener growth, helping to lead an $8. 5 billion partnership to decarbonise what is currently the most carbon-intensive energy system in the world, and by choking off international finance for coal.  I look forward to working with you all as we take forward these invest in clean green infrastructure.  And this is like one of those moments in the story of humanity, when everybody is making the same intellectual breakthrough at the same time in seeing the way forward in leveraging, in private finance, we have The Global Gateway, we have the One Planet Initiative, I think from Emmanuel, we have the Sustainable Markets Initiative from the Prince of Wales.  We have our Clean Green Initiative.  We have Built Back Better World.  We have GFANZ from Mark Carney.  Everybody is now on the same thing.  It’s time to bring all this together so that this can be the moment when we get real on levelling up the world and securing a cleaner, greener, and more prosperous future for everybody.  Thank you. 

Boris:

Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome to COP.  Welcome to Glasgow and to Scotland, whose most globally famous fictional son is almost certainly a man called James Bond, who generally comes to the climax of his highly lucrative films, strapped to a doomsday device, desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off, while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it.  And we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global leaders, as James Bond today.  Except that the tragedy is this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.  And the clock is ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines with which we are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster, record outputs, and quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2, raising the temperature of the planet with a speed and an abruptness that is entirely man-made.  And we know what the scientists tell us, and we have learned not to ignore them.  Two degrees more, and we jeopardise the food supply for hundreds of millions of people as crops, wither locusts swarm.  Three degrees and you can add more wildfires and cyclones, twice as many, five times as many droughts, and 36 times as many heat waves.  Four degrees, and we say goodbye to whole cities.  Miami, Alexandria, Shanghai, all lost beneath the waves.  And the longer we fail to act, the worse it gets and the higher the price when we are eventually forced, by catastrophe, to act.  Because humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change.  It’s one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock, and we need to act now.  If we don’t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow.  

Boris:

I was there with many of you in Copenhagen 11 years ago, when we acknowledged we had a problem.  I was there in Paris six years ago when we agreed to net zero, and to try to restrain the rise in the temperature of the planet to 1. 5 degrees.  And all those promises will be nothing but “blah, blah, blah,” to coin a phrase, and the anger and the impatience of the world will be uncontainable unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change.  And we can.  We can get real on coal, cars, cash, and trees.  We have the technology to deactivate that ticking doomsday device.  Not all at once.  I’m afraid it’s too late for that.  But one by one, and with ever greater speed and efficiency, we can begin to close down those billions of hydrocarbon combustion chambers that you find currently in every corner of the planet.  We can phase out the use of cars with hydrocarbon internal combustion engines by 2035.  We can do that.  

Boris:

We in the UK are leading, by ending new sales by 2030.  We can end the use of coal-fired power stations.  We can do it by 2040 in the developing world, 2030 in the richer nations.  We can plant hundreds of millions of trees, a trillion, it’s not technologically difficult, and halt and reverse deforestation by 2030.  Not just because it’s a spiritually uplifting and beautiful thing to do, but because that is the way to restore the balance of nature and to fix carbon in the air.  And as we look at the green industrial revolution that’s now needed around the world, we in the developed world must recognise the special responsibility we have to help everybody else to do it.  Because it was here in Glasgow, 250 years ago, that James Watt came up with a machine that was powered by steam, that was produced by burning coal.  And yes, my friends, we’ve brought you to the very place where the doomsday machine began to tick.  And even though for 200 years, the industrialised countries were in complete ignorance of the problem that they were creating, we now have a duty to find those funds: a hundred billion a year that was promised in Paris by 2020, but which we won’t deliver until 2023, to help the rest of the world to move to green technology.  But we cannot and will not succeed by government spending alone.  We in this room can deploy hundreds of billions.  No question.  But the market has hundreds of trillions.  And the task now is to work together to help our friends to decarbonise, using our funds, the funds we have in development assistance, and working with all the multilateral development banks so that, in the key countries that need to make progress, we can jointly identify the projects that we can help to de-risk, so that the private sector money can come in, in just the same way that it was the private sector that enabled the UK to end our dependence on coal, become the Saudi Arabia of wind.  

Boris:

We have the technology.  We can find the finance, and we must, and the question for us all today is whether we have the will.  And my fellow leaders, as I look around this room, I don’t want to put too fine a point on it, but we all talk about what we’re going to do in 2050 or 2060.  I don’t think it will escape the notice of the crowds of young people outside, the billions who are watching around the world, half of the population of the world under 30, that the average age of this conclave of world leaders, I’m afraid to say, is over 60.  I fully intend to be alive in 2060.  I will be a mere 94 years old, even if I’m not still in Downing Street.  But you never know.  But the children, the children who will judge us, are children not yet born.  And their children.  And we are now coming centre stage before a vast and uncountable audience of posterity, and we mustn’t fluff our lines or miss our cue.  Because if we fail, they will not forgive us.  They will know that Glasgow was the historic turning point when history failed to turn.  They will do judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today.  And they will be right.  COP26 will not, and cannot, be the end of the story on climate change.  Even if this conference ends with binding global commitments for game-changing real-world action, two weeks from now, smoke stacks will still belch in industrial heartlands.  Cows will still belch in their pastures, even if some brilliant Kiwi scientists are teaching them how to be more polite.  Cars powered by petrol and diesel will still choke congested roads in the world’s great cities.  

Boris:

No one conference could ever change that.  If summits alone solved climate change, then we wouldn’t have needed 25 previous COP summits to get where we are today.  But while COP26 will not be the end of climate change, it can, and it must, mark the beginning of the end.  In the years since Paris, the world has slowly, and with great effort and pain, built a life boat for humanity.  And now is the time to give that life boat a mighty shove into the water, like some great liner, rolling down the slipways of the Clyde.  Take a sextant sighting on 1. 5 degrees and set off on a journey to a cleaner greener future.  So let us, therefore, in the next days, devote ourselves to this extraordinary task so that we not only continue with a program that is a green industrial revolution that is already creating millions of high-wage, high-skilled jobs in power and technology, taking our economies forward, let us also do enough to save our planet and our way of life.  And as we work, let us think about those billions of beady eyes that are watching us around the world, increasingly edgy and disenchanted.  And let us think of the billions more of the unborn, whose anger will be all the greater if we fail.  We cannot let them down.  

Boris:

We have the ideas.  We have the technology.  We have the bankers.  We have the corporations and the NGOs.  We have the interpreters.  We have the meeting rooms.  If all else fails, we have the unbeatable hospitality and refreshment of Glasgow.  We may not feel much like James Bond.  Not all of us necessarily look like James Bond.  But we have the opportunity, and we have the duty, to make this summit the moment when humanity finally began, and I stress “began,” to defuse that bomb, and to make this the moment when we began irrefutably to turn the tide, and to begin the fight back against climate change.  Yes, it’s going to be hard.  But yes, we can do it.  And so let’s get to work with all the creativity and imagination and goodwill that we possess.  Thank you very much, and good luck to all of us.  Thank you. 

Boris:

Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everyone.  Fantastic to see you all here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let’s get going.  Let’s get on with the job.  Good morning, everybody listening.  So isn’t it amazing to be back here in person? And the first time since so many of you worked to defy the skeptics by winning councils and communities that Conservatives have never won in before, such as Hartlepool.  And in fact, it’s the first time since the general election of 2019, when we finally sent that corduroy communist cosmonaut into orbit, where he belongs.  And why is it that we are back today for a traditional Conservative cheek by jowler? It’s because for months we have had one of the most open economies and societies.  And on July the 19th, we decided to open every single theater and every concert hall and nightclub in England.  And we knew that some people would still be anxious, so we sent top government representatives to our sweatiest [French 00:01:20] to show that anyone could dance perfectly safely.  And wasn’t he brilliant, my friends? Let’s hear it.  Let’s hear it for Jon Bon Govi.  Living proof that we, you all represent the most jiving, hip, happening and generally funkapolitan party in the world. 

Boris:

How have we managed to open up ahead of so many of our friends? You know the answer, it’s because of the rollout of that vaccine.  A UK phenomenon, the magic potion invented in Oxford University, bottled in Wales, distributed at incredible speed to vaccination centres everywhere.  I saw The Army in action in Glasgow, firing staple guns like carbines as they set up a huge vaccination centre.  In Fermanagh I saw the needles go in like a collective sewing machine.  They vaccinated so rapidly that we were able to do those crucial groups one to four, the oldest and most vulnerable, faster than any other major economy in the world.  And though the disease has sadly not gone away, the impact on death rates has been astonishing. 

Boris:

I urge you all to get your jabs, because every day our vaccine defences are getting stronger and stronger.  And you, all of you and everybody watching, you made this roll out possible.  You made each other safer.  So perhaps we should all thank each other.  Go on, try it.  I mean, you can try a cautious fist bump, because it’s okay now.  And we in turn thank the volunteers, the public health workers, the council workers, the pharmacists, but above all, our untiring, unbeatable, unbelievable NHS.  And as a responsible Conservative government, we must recognise the sheer scale of their achievement, but also the scale of the challenge ahead. 

Boris:

When I was lying in St.  Thomas’ Hospital last year, I looked blearily out of my window at a hole in the ground between the ICU and another much older Victorian section.  And amid the rubble of brick, they seemed to be digging a hole for someone or something, or indeed someone, possibly me.  But the NHS saved me and our wonderful nurses pulled my chestnuts out of that Tartarian pit.  And I went back on a visit the other day, and I saw that the hole had been filled in with three or four gleaming stories of a new pediatrics unit.  And there you have a metaphor my friends for how we must build back better now.  We have a huge hole in the public finances.  We spent 407 billion pounds on COVID support and our debt now stands at over 2 trillion pounds.  And waiting lists will almost certainly go up before they come down. 

Boris:

COVID pushed out a great bow wave of cases.  People did not or could not seek help.  And that wave is now coming back.  A tide of anxiety washing into every A&E and every GP.  Your hip replacement, your mother’s surgery.  And this is the priority of the British people.  Does anyone seriously imagine that we should not now be raising the funding to sort this out? Is that really the view of responsible Conservatives? I can tell you something, Margaret Thatcher would not have ignored the meteorite that has just crashed through the public finances.  She would’ve wagged her finger and said, “More borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later. ”

Boris:

When this country was sick, our NHS was the nurse.  Frontline care workers battled against a new disease, selflessly risking their lives, sacrificing their lives.  And it is right that this party that has looked after the NHS for most of its history should be the one to rise to the challenge.  48 new hospitals, 50,000 more nurses, 50 million more GP appointments, 40 new diagnostic centers.  And fixing those backlogs with real change, because the pandemic not only put colossal pressure on the NHS, it was a lightning flash illumination of a problem we have failed to address for decades. 

Boris:

In 1948, this country created the National Health Service but kept social care local.  And though that made sense in many ways, generations of older people have found themselves lost in the gap.  When COVID broke, the 100,000 beds in the NHS and 30,000 occupied by people who could have been cared for elsewhere, whether at home or in residential care.  And we all know that this problem of delayed discharge is one of the major reasons why it takes too long to get the hospital treatment that your family desperately need.  And people worry that they will be the 1 in 10 to suffer from the potentially catastrophic cost of dementia, wiping out everything they have and preventing them from passing on anything to their families.  And we Conservatives stand by those who have shared our values, thrift and hard work, and who face total destitution in this brutal lottery of old age, in which treatment for cancer is funded by the state and care for Alzheimer’s is not, or only partly.  And to fix these twin problems of the NHS and social care, we aren’t just going to siphon billions of new taxes into crucial services without improving performance.  We will use new technology so that there is a single set of electronic records as patients pass between health and social care, improving care, and ensuring that cash goes to the front line and not on needless bureaucracy. 

Boris:

When I stood on the steps of Downing Street, I promised to fix this crisis.  And after decades of drift and dither, this reforming government, this can-do government, this government that got Brexit done, that’s getting the COVID vaccine roll out done, is going to get social care done and we are going to deal with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society.  The problems no government has had the guts to tackle before.  And I mean the long term, structural weaknesses in the UK economy.  It’s thanks to the vaccine rollout that we now have the most open economy and the fastest growth in the GCEP.  We have unemployment 2 million lower than forecast.  We have demand surging, and I’m pleased to say that after years of stagnation, more than a decade, wages are going up faster than before the pandemic began.  And that matters deeply because we are embarking now on a change of direction that has been long overdue in the UK economy.  We’re not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity, all of it enabled and assisted by uncontrolled immigration.  And the answer to the present stresses and strains, which are mainly a function of growth and economic revival, is not to reach for that same old lever of uncontrolled immigration to keep wages low. 

Boris:

The answer is to control immigration, to allow people of talent to come to this country, but not to use immigration as an excuse for failure to invest in people, in skills, and in the equipment, the facilities, the machinery.  Or in the machinery, the facilities they need do their jobs.  The truck stops, to pick an example entirely at random, with basic facilities where you don’t have to urinate in the bushes.  And that is the direction in which this country is going now, towards a high wage, high skill, high productivity, and yes, thereby a low tax economy, that that is what the people in this country need and deserve.  In which everyone can take pride in their work and in the quality of their work.  And yes, it will take time and sometimes it will be difficult, but that was the change that people voted for in 2016.  And that was the change that people voted for again, powerfully in 2019.  And to deliver that change, we will get on with our job of uniting and levelling up across the UK, the greatest project that any government can embark on.  We have one of the most imbalanced societies and lopsided economies of all the richer countries.  It’s not just that there’s a gap between London and the Southeast and the rest of the country, there are aching gaps within the regions themselves. 

Boris:

What monkey glands are they applying in Ribble Valley? What royal jelly are they eating, that they live seven years longer than the people of Blackpool, only 33 miles away? Why does half of York’s population boast a degree and only a quarter of Doncaster’s? That is not just a question of social justice, it is an appalling waste of potential.  And it is holding this country back.  Because there is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others, or why people should feel they have to move away from their loved ones or communities to reach their potential.  When Thomas Gray stood in that country churchyard in 1750 and wrote his famous elegy as the curfew toll the knell of parting day, he lamented the wasted talents of those buried around him, the flowers born to blush unseen, the mute inglorious Miltons, who never wrote a poem because they never got to read.  The simple folk who died illiterate and enumerate.  And he knew that that was an injustice.  Let me ask you, maybe you know, where was he standing when he chewed his pensive quill? Anybody know? Correct. 

Boris:

My friends, there may be underprivileged parts of our country, but Stoke Poges is not now among them.  In fact, it was only recently determined by the Daily Telegraph, if you can’t believe that, what can you believe, my friends, to be the eighth richest village in England.  Since Gray eulogised, Buckinghamshire has levelled up to be among the most productive regions in the whole of Europe.  Stoke Poges may still, of course, have its problems, but they are overwhelmingly caused by the sheer lust of other people to live in or near Stoke Poges.  Overcrowded trains, endless commutes, too little time with the kids, the constant anxiety that your immemorial view of chalk downland is going be desecrated by ugly new homes.  That is why levelling up works for the whole country, and it is the right and responsible policy because it helps to take the pressure off parts of the overheating Southeast while simultaneously offering hope and opportunity to those areas that have felt left behind. 

Boris:

Let’s be clear that there is a huge philosophical difference between us and Labour, because in their souls, they don’t like levelling up.  They don’t like levelling up.  They like levelling down.  They do.  They like decapitating the tour poppies and taxing the rich till the pips squeak, and they dislike academic competition.  Latin, I hear.  In Islington, I kid you not, I’ve seen it with my own eyes, they like kids to run races, I’ve seen this, where nobody actually wins.  I have to tell you, I don’t think that is a good preparation for life, let alone for the Olympic games.  

Boris:

If you insist on the economic theory behind levelling up, it’s contained in the inside of Vilfredo Pareto, a 19th-century Italian figure who floated from the cobwebbed attic of my memories.  “There are all kinds of improvements that you can make to people’s lives,” he said, “without diminishing everyone else. ” Rishi will, I’m sure, confirm this.  We call these “Pareto improvements,” right? They are the means of levelling up.  The idea in a nutshell is that you will find talent, genius, flare, imagination, enthusiasm everywhere in this country, all of them evenly distributed, evenly distributed, but opportunity is not.  And it is our mission as Conservatives to promote opportunity with every tool we have.  It is still a grim fact that in this country.  That’s right.  It’s all about opportunity.  But it’s still a grim fact that in this country, some kids will grow up in neighborhoods that are much safer than others, and some will be as, as [Pretty 00:16:20] was saying, some will be sucked into gangs, some will be at risk of stabbing and shooting, some will get themselves caught in the one-way ratchet of the criminal justice system.  Many others will not.  That’s why levelling up means fighting crime, putting more police out on the beat, as we are, toughening sentences, rolling up the county lines, drugs networks, as we are, 1,100 of them gone already, giving the police the power they need to fight these dealers in death and misery.  That’s what we want to do.  What’s labor’s answer, by the way? To decriminalise hard drugs, apparently, to let the gangsters off with a caution.  An answer that is straight from the powder rooms of North London dinner parties and nothing to do with the real needs of this country. 

Boris:

Crime has been falling.  Not just, by the way, because we took the precaution of locking up the public for much of the last 18 months, but because you have a Conservative government that understands the Broken Windows theory of fighting crime.  I read a learned article by some lawyer saying we shouldn’t bother about pet theft.  Pet theft.  Well, I say to Cruella Deville, QC, if you can steal a dog or a cat, then there is frankly no limit to your depravity.  Those people gluing themselves to roads, I don’t call them legitimate protestors, like some Labour counsellors do.  I think that some Labour counsellors actually glue themselves to roads.  I say, they are a confounded nuisance who are blocking ambulances, stopping people going about their daily lives, and I’m glad Pretty is taking new powers to insulate them snugly in prison where they belong. 

Boris:

What I find most incredible of all was the decision by Labour, now led by lefty Islington lawyers, to vote against tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders.  On behalf of the entire government, I tell you this, we will not rest until we have increased the successful prosecutions for rape, because too many lying, bullying, cowardly men are using the laws delay to get away with violence against women.  And we cannot, and we will not stand for it.  I know that there are some who tell us that we’re being ungenerous and unfeeling in our attempts to control our borders.  I say, don’t give me that, this is the government that stood up to China and announced that we would provide a haven for British overseas nationals from Hong Kong.  30,000 have already applied.  I’m really proud to be part of a Conservative government that will welcome 20,000 Afghans, people who risked their lives to guide and translate for us.  We are doing the right and responsible thing. 

Boris:

Speaking as the great grandson of a Turk who fled in fear of his life, I know that this country is a beacon of light and hope for people around the world, provided they come here legally.  Provided we understand who they are and what they want to contribute.  That’s why we took back control of our borders and will pass the Borders bill, because we believe there must be a distinction between someone who comes here legally and someone who doesn’t.  And though I have every sympathy with people genuinely in fear of their lives, I have no sympathy whatever with the people traffickers who take thousands of pounds to send children to sea in frail and dangerous craft and we must end this lethal trade.  We must break the gangsters’ business model.  Is it not a sublime irony that even in French politics there is now a leading centre right politician calling for a referendum on the EU, who is now calling for France.  It’s good old Michel Barnier.  That’s what happens if you spend a year trying to argue with Lord Frost, the greatest Frost since the great frost of 1709.  We will fight these gangs at home in abroad because their victims are invariably the poorest and the neediest. 

Boris:

I’ll tell you what levelling up is.  A few years ago, they started a school not far from the Olympic Park.  A new school anyone could send their kids to in an area that for decades has been one of the most disadvantaged in London.  That school is Brampton Manor Academy, and it now sends more kids to Oxbridge than Eton.  If you want proof of what I mean by unleashing potential and by levelling up, look at Brampton Manor.  We can do it.  There is absolutely no reason why the kids of this country should lag behind and why so many should be unable to read or write or do basic mathematics at 11.  To level up, on top of the extra 14 billion we’re putting into education, on top of the increase that means every teacher starts with a salary of 30,000 pounds, we’re announcing today a levelling up premium of up to 3,000 pounds to send the best maths and science teachers to the places that need the most. 

Boris:

Above all, we’re investing in our skills.  Skills, folks.  Our universities are world beating.  I owe everything to my tutors.  They’re one of the great glories of our economy.  But we all know that some of the most brilliant, imaginative and creative people in Britain, some of the best-paid people in Britain, did not go to university.  To level up, you need to give people the options, the skills, that are right for them.  To make the most of those skills and knowledge, you need urgently to plug all the other gaps in the infrastructure that are still holding people and communities back. 

Boris:

Transport is one of the supreme leveller uppers, and we are making the big generational changes shirked by previous governments.  We will do northern powerhouse rail.  We will link up the cities of the Midlands of the north.  We will restore those sinews of the union that have been allowed to atrophy: The A1 north of Berwick and on into Scotland, the A75 in Scotland that is so vital for the links with Northern Ireland and the rest of the country, the North Wales corridor.  Yes.  And we will invest in our roads, unblocking, those coagulated, roundabouts and steering wheel bending traffic lights.  We’re putting on 4,000 more clean, green buses made in this country, some of them running on hydrogen. 

Boris:

The great ambition of the human race, that the left always privately share but publicly disparage.  And we can do it.  Look at this country from the air, go on Google Maps.  You see how our landscape has been plotted and pieced and jigsawed together by centuries of bequests and litigation, a vast testament to security of titled trust in the law.  And it’s a confidence that is responsible for so much international investment.  You see how rich this country is growing, the billions of loving and incremental improvements to homes and gardens. 

Boris:

Build back beaver, I say.  Build back beaver.  Though the beavers may sometimes build without local authority permission, you can also see how much room there is to build the homes that young families need in this country.  Not on green fields, not just jammed in the Southeast, but beautiful homes on Brownfield sites in places where homes make sense. 

Boris:

There is no happiness like taking a set of keys and knowing the place is yours.  And you can paint the front door any colour you like.  As it happens, I can’t paint my own front door any colour I like.  It has to be black, but I certainly don’t have to go very far to work.  And if you don’t have to go far to work and your commute isn’t too dreadful, and if the job suits your skills and your wifi is fast and reliable, I’ll tell you something else, that housing in the right place and at an affordable price will add massively, not just to your general joie de vivre, but to your productivity. 
Boris:

Right now our best single defence against Omicron is to get vaccinated and to get boosted.  If you’re boosted your immune response will be stronger.  Yesterday, in addition to offering a second dose to all twelve to fifteen year olds, the independent JCVI recommended that boosters should now be offered to everyone over 18 and that we halve the minimum gap between a second dose and a booster from six months to three months.  That means that over 14 million more adults have now become eligible for a booster in England alone.  I am here today with the health secretary Sajid Javid and Amanda Pritchard chief executive of NHS England to set out our plan to make this happen. 
The target that we’ve set ourselves is to offer a booster to everyone eligible by the end of January.  As with the first jabs, we’ll be working through people by age group, going down in five year bands because it’s vital that the older and the more clinically vulnerable get that added protection first.  Even if you’ve had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don’t book until the NHS says it’s your turn.  We’ve already done almost eighteen million boosters across the UK, but we’ve got millions more to do to protect the most vulnerable.  Then we’ll move down the cohorts rapidly and working together with the Department of Administrations, we want to ramp up capacity across the whole United Kingdom to the levels we achieved in the previous vaccination effort. 
We’re going to be throwing everything at it in order to ensure that everyone eligible is offered that booster in, as I say, just over two months.  Across England we’ll have more than one thousand five hundred community pharmacy sites, vaccinating people near where you live.  All of our sites will increase their capacity and will stand up extra hospital hubs on top of those already active.  There’ll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees and will deploy at least four hundred military personnel to assist the efforts of our NHS, alongside of course, the fantastic jabs army of volunteers. 
I know the frustration that we all feel with this Omicron variant, the sense of exhaustion that we could be going through all this all over again, but today I want to stress this.  Today, that’s the wrong thing to feel because today our position is and always will be immeasurably better than it was a year ago.  What we’re doing is taking some proportionate precautionary measures while our scientists crack the Omicron code and while we get the added protection of those boosters into the arms of those who need them most.  We’re going to get behind the men and women of our NHS who’ve saved so many lives on the frontline and run our vaccination program for a year, almost without a break as they have and who are going back into the breach yet again.  I want to say on behalf of the entire country, a thank you to each and every one of them for their extraordinary efforts.  The best way we can all show our gratitude is by doing our bit and stepping forward when our time comes to get that booster. 
I’ve been waiting patiently for my moment to come.  It’s happening on Thursday, I’m pleased to say.  Whenever your turn comes, get your booster and ask your friends and your family to do the same.  It’s time for another great British vaccination effort.  We’ve done it before and we’re going to do it again and let’s not give this virus a second chance.  Thank you very much.  

Boris:

Well, Alex, thank you very much for that and that’s a question that’s been asked a lot in the why aren’t we doing face coverings all over the place? And the answer is that we’re trying to take a balanced and a proportionate approach, Alex, slowing down the spread of, of Omicron while we get to the bottom of the exact effect that it has.  But, Sajid, do you want to add on that?

Boris:

Tanith from Surrey asks, “Given the concerns of the Omicron variant being more highly transmissible and possibly bypassing the vaccines, what is the government doing to protect those designated as clinically extremely vulnerable, especially in those who are immunosuppressed in which the current vaccines do not have the same efficacy, as in say, a normal, healthy person who is not immunocompromised?” Saj, I think you touched on that earlier on. 

Boris:

Thanks very much, Vicky.  So the answer is no, the guidance remains the same and we’re trying to take a balanced and proportionate approach and as I explained on Saturday when talking for the first time to everybody about Omicron, we’re really dealing with two variants at the same time.  We’ve got the measures in place to fight Delta, which we think are appropriate and then we’re bringing in some tougher measures to stop the seeding. Then we’re bringing in some tougher measures to stop the seeding, the rapid seeding of Omicron in this country, to give us the time we need to get the boosters in and of course, to find out more.  Those measures, as you know, are the tough measures.  The borders, the PCR test.  When you arrive, quarantine until you’ve got a negative result, then tougher measures on masks, and then making sure that contact for anybody who comes into contact with an Omicron case also has to quarantine.  We think that’s the right balance and we will keep it of course, under constant review. 

Boris:

I should say, of course, we’ve got tougher measures, even tougher measures for travel for those countries, for those 10 countries, that seem to have particular problems with Omicron.  Is that it? I think that was it.  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  Sorry. 

Boris:

Well, first of all, the guidance remains the same.  That doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t take sensible precautions and everybody should continue for instance, to wash your hands and make sure that you have good ventilation and wear a mask when you are in a confined space with people you don’t normally meet.  What we’re doing is we’re toughening up the regulations in a specific ways that I’ve outlined to deal with Omicron and I think that’s the right approach.  We’re taking a balanced under and a proportionate approach.  But as I said, I think on Saturday, the most important thing is we still think that your best single of protection against all variances to get the booster and I’m still confident that this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas and that remains my view forty eight hours later. 

Boris:

Thank you.  I think Amanda, your first. 

Boris:

And Ben, on your question, the crucial thing, the $64 million question, or billion dollar question, whatever is, does this new variant beat the vaccines and does it beat… Particularly, does it beat the booster? As I’ve said over the last few days, we think that the chances are that the boosters will continue to give you protection against every variant, protection of some degree.  That’s why it’s so absolutely vital to get the boosters but we need to check that.  We can’t… This is what we think, but we need to check that and that’s why we’re waiting to see what the science tells us.  What I can certainly tell you is that the measures that we’ve put in place will not last a minute more than we think they are strictly necessary for the protection of public health. 

Boris:

Thank you.  Yes, and Jason, just on your point about Christmas parties and Nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.  And we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in school, as I’ve said many times throughout this pandemic.  What we’re doing is trying to take a balanced and proportionate approach to the particular risk that seems to be posed by Omicron, or certainly is posed by Omicron, are focused in particular on measures at the borders.  And we think that’s the right way to go for the time being, until we know more and until we can get more boosters, as we’ve been saying, into people’s arms.  Can we go to Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe of the FT, please?

Boris:

Oh, sorry.  Thanks, Jasmine.  We haven’t ruled out anything.  I’ve got to tell you, I think another lockdown of the kind that we’ve had before is extremely unlikely.  I’ll be up front with you about that, but we keep everything under constant review.  In our fight against the Delta variant, we think that it’s basically been going our way or going the way that we planned.  Although cases remain high or high-ish, you are seeing a decline in the numbers of admissions to hospital and a decline in the number of deaths.  And that’s the crucial thing that we’ve been following.  So at the moment, we see no cause to move to plan B.  But as I’ve said to you many, many times before, we’ve got to keep that under review.  But the measures we’re talking about to deal with Omicron are, as I’ve said, distinct. 

Boris:

Thanks, Joe.  So on your point about working from home, this is not something that we think currently is necessary for the reasons I gave to Jasmine.  We’ve got a package of measures that we have in place to deal with the Delta variant, and that’s principally been rolling out the vaccine and it’s been working.  And I repeat what I said just now about the numbers of deaths and hospitalisations coming down.  We now have a particular issue to deal with the potential seeding of the new Omicron variant.  And there, what we want to do is focus particularly on tough measures at the borders.  We’re also doing something to stop transmission by reintroducing face masks in some settings.  So continuing to advise them in other settings, but tightening the rules on face masks.  And the reason for not proceeding with plan B is we want to take an approach that is proportionate and balanced and suits the needs of the present risk.  Of course, we will change things as necessary, but what we’re looking for is the first real reassurance that we need that the vaccines are efficacious against this variant.  Even if the effectiveness is reduced, it’s still very important to know whether they’re effective or not.  And in particular, we need to know quite how effective the boosters are.  As I’ve said, we think there are good grounds for believing that the boosters will give you, under all circumstances, the protection that you need, considerable protection.  

Boris:

That’s why the most important thing for everybody to do is go out and get your booster.  And that’s the number one thing that people need to be doing.  Thank you all very much.  Listen, I just want to say something, because nobody’s asked about it so far.  I just want to say something about Storm Arwen and its effect on the north of the country.  And I just want to say how I’m extremely sympathetic to everybody who’s suffered these power outages and it must be appalling.  I think a million homes lost their electricity.  950,000 have seen that electricity now restored.  But clearly, for 50,000 people, that is not good enough.  And I want to reassure everybody that we’re working as hard as we can to get power back to those homes.  All I can say is the gusts were going at 100 miles an hour, and talking to the people who operate the grid, they say that there was nothing that they could do about it.  But we are doing everything we can to restore power, talking to Northern Power grid and everybody else to get that fixed.  And I appreciate it.  It must be a very, very tough time for those homes that are currently without power.  And I’m afraid that is all we have time for.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you. 

Boris:

Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much dear Ursula.  And thank you everybody.  Thanks Joe and Ursula for hosting this meeting, and you’re absolutely right that we began this idea with the Build Better Partnership in Carbis Bay.  To keep 1. 5 degrees in sight to reach global net-zero and to protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of climate change means the development of new clean and green infrastructure.  And this presents a huge opportunity to turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission as President Biden has said for jobs and growth.  In the UK, through our net-zero strategy, we are pioneering a green industrial revolution with public investment, leveraging billions of pounds of private funding into whole new industries from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage, allowing us in the UK to level up our whole country with thousands of good new green jobs, and by partnering with developing and emerging economies to invest in climate-smart infrastructure and meeting our $100 billion climate finance commitment.  

Boris:

Of course, we can go on to unlock trillions, whether it’s tens of trillions or hundreds of trillions, as Mark Carney would say, of private finance to do something similar around the whole world.  So our pursuit of global net-zero can drive global levelling up, helping developing economies fast track their way to a more prosperous, clean and green future.  So the UK wholeheartedly supports the principles that President Biden has set out, working in partnership to create the highest standards of climate-resilient infrastructure rooted in our shared democratic values of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, and led by the host countries, responding to their needs.  And I welcome the work of Mark Carney and others on creating what we call country platforms help connect the pipelines of green infrastructure projects with the vast private capital looking to invest in net-zero.  The UK is proud to contribute to these efforts today with our Clean Green Initiative, as you say, Ursula, by taking our green industrial revolution global, we’re investing over 3 billion pounds and mobilising a similar amount of private finance to support technologies like drought-resistant agriculture, where investors have been reluctant to take the risks alone.  We’re investing in green bonds for renewable energy in Vietnam, and solar power in Burkina Faso, Pakistan, Nepal, and Czech.  

Boris:

We’re offering guarantees to The World Bank and The African Development Bank to unlock up to 2. 2 billion pounds of new finance for green infrastructure across India and Africa.  And we’re working with President Ramaphosa, Cyril Ramaphosa, to deliver his ambitious vision for faster greener growth, helping to lead an $8. 5 billion partnership to decarbonise what is currently the most carbon-intensive energy system in the world, and by choking off international finance for coal.  I look forward to working with you all as we take forward these invest in clean green infrastructure.  And this is like one of those moments in the story of humanity, when everybody is making the same intellectual breakthrough at the same time in seeing the way forward in leveraging, in private finance, we have The Global Gateway, we have the One Planet Initiative, I think from Emmanuel, we have the Sustainable Markets Initiative from the Prince of Wales.  We have our Clean Green Initiative.  We have Built Back Better World.  We have GFANZ from Mark Carney.  Everybody is now on the same thing.  It’s time to bring all this together so that this can be the moment when we get real on levelling up the world and securing a cleaner, greener, and more prosperous future for everybody.  Thank you. 

Boris:

Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome to COP.  Welcome to Glasgow and to Scotland, whose most globally famous fictional son is almost certainly a man called James Bond, who generally comes to the climax of his highly lucrative films, strapped to a doomsday device, desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off, while a red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it.  And we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global leaders, as James Bond today.  Except that the tragedy is this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.  And the clock is ticking to the furious rhythm of hundreds of billions of pistons and turbines and furnaces and engines with which we are pumping carbon into the air faster and faster, record outputs, and quilting the earth in an invisible and suffocating blanket of CO2, raising the temperature of the planet with a speed and an abruptness that is entirely man-made.  And we know what the scientists tell us, and we have learned not to ignore them.  Two degrees more, and we jeopardise the food supply for hundreds of millions of people as crops, wither locusts swarm.  Three degrees and you can add more wildfires and cyclones, twice as many, five times as many droughts, and 36 times as many heat waves.  Four degrees, and we say goodbye to whole cities.  Miami, Alexandria, Shanghai, all lost beneath the waves.  And the longer we fail to act, the worse it gets and the higher the price when we are eventually forced, by catastrophe, to act.  Because humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change.  It’s one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock, and we need to act now.  If we don’t get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow.  

Boris:

I was there with many of you in Copenhagen 11 years ago, when we acknowledged we had a problem.  I was there in Paris six years ago when we agreed to net zero, and to try to restrain the rise in the temperature of the planet to 1. 5 degrees.  And all those promises will be nothing but “blah, blah, blah,” to coin a phrase, and the anger and the impatience of the world will be uncontainable unless we make this COP26 in Glasgow the moment when we get real about climate change.  And we can.  We can get real on coal, cars, cash, and trees.  We have the technology to deactivate that ticking doomsday device.  Not all at once.  I’m afraid it’s too late for that.  But one by one, and with ever greater speed and efficiency, we can begin to close down those billions of hydrocarbon combustion chambers that you find currently in every corner of the planet.  We can phase out the use of cars with hydrocarbon internal combustion engines by 2035.  We can do that.  

Boris:

We in the UK are leading, by ending new sales by 2030.  We can end the use of coal-fired power stations.  We can do it by 2040 in the developing world, 2030 in the richer nations.  We can plant hundreds of millions of trees, a trillion, it’s not technologically difficult, and halt and reverse deforestation by 2030.  Not just because it’s a spiritually uplifting and beautiful thing to do, but because that is the way to restore the balance of nature and to fix carbon in the air.  And as we look at the green industrial revolution that’s now needed around the world, we in the developed world must recognise the special responsibility we have to help everybody else to do it.  Because it was here in Glasgow, 250 years ago, that James Watt came up with a machine that was powered by steam, that was produced by burning coal.  And yes, my friends, we’ve brought you to the very place where the doomsday machine began to tick.  And even though for 200 years, the industrialised countries were in complete ignorance of the problem that they were creating, we now have a duty to find those funds: a hundred billion a year that was promised in Paris by 2020, but which we won’t deliver until 2023, to help the rest of the world to move to green technology.  But we cannot and will not succeed by government spending alone.  We in this room can deploy hundreds of billions.  No question.  But the market has hundreds of trillions.  And the task now is to work together to help our friends to decarbonise, using our funds, the funds we have in development assistance, and working with all the multilateral development banks so that, in the key countries that need to make progress, we can jointly identify the projects that we can help to de-risk, so that the private sector money can come in, in just the same way that it was the private sector that enabled the UK to end our dependence on coal, become the Saudi Arabia of wind.  

Boris:

We have the technology.  We can find the finance, and we must, and the question for us all today is whether we have the will.  And my fellow leaders, as I look around this room, I don’t want to put too fine a point on it, but we all talk about what we’re going to do in 2050 or 2060.  I don’t think it will escape the notice of the crowds of young people outside, the billions who are watching around the world, half of the population of the world under 30, that the average age of this conclave of world leaders, I’m afraid to say, is over 60.  I fully intend to be alive in 2060.  I will be a mere 94 years old, even if I’m not still in Downing Street.  But you never know.  But the children, the children who will judge us, are children not yet born.  And their children.  And we are now coming centre stage before a vast and uncountable audience of posterity, and we mustn’t fluff our lines or miss our cue.  Because if we fail, they will not forgive us.  They will know that Glasgow was the historic turning point when history failed to turn.  They will do judge us with bitterness and with a resentment that eclipses any of the climate activists of today.  And they will be right.  COP26 will not, and cannot, be the end of the story on climate change.  Even if this conference ends with binding global commitments for game-changing real-world action, two weeks from now, smoke stacks will still belch in industrial heartlands.  Cows will still belch in their pastures, even if some brilliant Kiwi scientists are teaching them how to be more polite.  Cars powered by petrol and diesel will still choke congested roads in the world’s great cities.  

Boris:

No one conference could ever change that.  If summits alone solved climate change, then we wouldn’t have needed 25 previous COP summits to get where we are today.  But while COP26 will not be the end of climate change, it can, and it must, mark the beginning of the end.  In the years since Paris, the world has slowly, and with great effort and pain, built a life boat for humanity.  And now is the time to give that life boat a mighty shove into the water, like some great liner, rolling down the slipways of the Clyde.  Take a sextant sighting on 1. 5 degrees and set off on a journey to a cleaner greener future.  So let us, therefore, in the next days, devote ourselves to this extraordinary task so that we not only continue with a program that is a green industrial revolution that is already creating millions of high-wage, high-skilled jobs in power and technology, taking our economies forward, let us also do enough to save our planet and our way of life.  And as we work, let us think about those billions of beady eyes that are watching us around the world, increasingly edgy and disenchanted.  And let us think of the billions more of the unborn, whose anger will be all the greater if we fail.  We cannot let them down.  

Boris:

We have the ideas.  We have the technology.  We have the bankers.  We have the corporations and the NGOs.  We have the interpreters.  We have the meeting rooms.  If all else fails, we have the unbeatable hospitality and refreshment of Glasgow.  We may not feel much like James Bond.  Not all of us necessarily look like James Bond.  But we have the opportunity, and we have the duty, to make this summit the moment when humanity finally began, and I stress “began,” to defuse that bomb, and to make this the moment when we began irrefutably to turn the tide, and to begin the fight back against climate change.  Yes, it’s going to be hard.  But yes, we can do it.  And so let’s get to work with all the creativity and imagination and goodwill that we possess.  Thank you very much, and good luck to all of us.  Thank you. 

Boris:

Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning, everyone.  Fantastic to see you all here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let’s get going.  Let’s get on with the job.  Good morning, everybody listening.  So isn’t it amazing to be back here in person? And the first time since so many of you worked to defy the skeptics by winning councils and communities that Conservatives have never won in before, such as Hartlepool.  And in fact, it’s the first time since the general election of 2019, when we finally sent that corduroy communist cosmonaut into orbit, where he belongs.  And why is it that we are back today for a traditional Conservative cheek by jowler? It’s because for months we have had one of the most open economies and societies.  And on July the 19th, we decided to open every single theater and every concert hall and nightclub in England.  And we knew that some people would still be anxious, so we sent top government representatives to our sweatiest [French 00:01:20] to show that anyone could dance perfectly safely.  And wasn’t he brilliant, my friends? Let’s hear it.  Let’s hear it for Jon Bon Govi.  Living proof that we, you all represent the most jiving, hip, happening and generally funkapolitan party in the world. 

Boris:

How have we managed to open up ahead of so many of our friends? You know the answer, it’s because of the rollout of that vaccine.  A UK phenomenon, the magic potion invented in Oxford University, bottled in Wales, distributed at incredible speed to vaccination centres everywhere.  I saw The Army in action in Glasgow, firing staple guns like carbines as they set up a huge vaccination centre.  In Fermanagh I saw the needles go in like a collective sewing machine.  They vaccinated so rapidly that we were able to do those crucial groups one to four, the oldest and most vulnerable, faster than any other major economy in the world.  And though the disease has sadly not gone away, the impact on death rates has been astonishing. 

Boris:

I urge you all to get your jabs, because every day our vaccine defences are getting stronger and stronger.  And you, all of you and everybody watching, you made this roll out possible.  You made each other safer.  So perhaps we should all thank each other.  Go on, try it.  I mean, you can try a cautious fist bump, because it’s okay now.  And we in turn thank the volunteers, the public health workers, the council workers, the pharmacists, but above all, our untiring, unbeatable, unbelievable NHS.  And as a responsible Conservative government, we must recognise the sheer scale of their achievement, but also the scale of the challenge ahead. 

Boris:

When I was lying in St.  Thomas’ Hospital last year, I looked blearily out of my window at a hole in the ground between the ICU and another much older Victorian section.  And amid the rubble of brick, they seemed to be digging a hole for someone or something, or indeed someone, possibly me.  But the NHS saved me and our wonderful nurses pulled my chestnuts out of that Tartarian pit.  And I went back on a visit the other day, and I saw that the hole had been filled in with three or four gleaming stories of a new pediatrics unit.  And there you have a metaphor my friends for how we must build back better now.  We have a huge hole in the public finances.  We spent 407 billion pounds on COVID support and our debt now stands at over 2 trillion pounds.  And waiting lists will almost certainly go up before they come down. 

Boris:

COVID pushed out a great bow wave of cases.  People did not or could not seek help.  And that wave is now coming back.  A tide of anxiety washing into every A&E and every GP.  Your hip replacement, your mother’s surgery.  And this is the priority of the British people.  Does anyone seriously imagine that we should not now be raising the funding to sort this out? Is that really the view of responsible Conservatives? I can tell you something, Margaret Thatcher would not have ignored the meteorite that has just crashed through the public finances.  She would’ve wagged her finger and said, “More borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later. ”

Boris:

When this country was sick, our NHS was the nurse.  Frontline care workers battled against a new disease, selflessly risking their lives, sacrificing their lives.  And it is right that this party that has looked after the NHS for most of its history should be the one to rise to the challenge.  48 new hospitals, 50,000 more nurses, 50 million more GP appointments, 40 new diagnostic centers.  And fixing those backlogs with real change, because the pandemic not only put colossal pressure on the NHS, it was a lightning flash illumination of a problem we have failed to address for decades. 

Boris:

In 1948, this country created the National Health Service but kept social care local.  And though that made sense in many ways, generations of older people have found themselves lost in the gap.  When COVID broke, the 100,000 beds in the NHS and 30,000 occupied by people who could have been cared for elsewhere, whether at home or in residential care.  And we all know that this problem of delayed discharge is one of the major reasons why it takes too long to get the hospital treatment that your family desperately need.  And people worry that they will be the 1 in 10 to suffer from the potentially catastrophic cost of dementia, wiping out everything they have and preventing them from passing on anything to their families.  And we Conservatives stand by those who have shared our values, thrift and hard work, and who face total destitution in this brutal lottery of old age, in which treatment for cancer is funded by the state and care for Alzheimer’s is not, or only partly.  And to fix these twin problems of the NHS and social care, we aren’t just going to siphon billions of new taxes into crucial services without improving performance.  We will use new technology so that there is a single set of electronic records as patients pass between health and social care, improving care, and ensuring that cash goes to the front line and not on needless bureaucracy. 

Boris:

When I stood on the steps of Downing Street, I promised to fix this crisis.  And after decades of drift and dither, this reforming government, this can-do government, this government that got Brexit done, that’s getting the COVID vaccine roll out done, is going to get social care done and we are going to deal with the biggest underlying issues of our economy and society.  The problems no government has had the guts to tackle before.  And I mean the long term, structural weaknesses in the UK economy.  It’s thanks to the vaccine rollout that we now have the most open economy and the fastest growth in the GCEP.  We have unemployment 2 million lower than forecast.  We have demand surging, and I’m pleased to say that after years of stagnation, more than a decade, wages are going up faster than before the pandemic began.  And that matters deeply because we are embarking now on a change of direction that has been long overdue in the UK economy.  We’re not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity, all of it enabled and assisted by uncontrolled immigration.  And the answer to the present stresses and strains, which are mainly a function of growth and economic revival, is not to reach for that same old lever of uncontrolled immigration to keep wages low. 

Boris:

The answer is to control immigration, to allow people of talent to come to this country, but not to use immigration as an excuse for failure to invest in people, in skills, and in the equipment, the facilities, the machinery.  Or in the machinery, the facilities they need do their jobs.  The truck stops, to pick an example entirely at random, with basic facilities where you don’t have to urinate in the bushes.  And that is the direction in which this country is going now, towards a high wage, high skill, high productivity, and yes, thereby a low tax economy, that that is what the people in this country need and deserve.  In which everyone can take pride in their work and in the quality of their work.  And yes, it will take time and sometimes it will be difficult, but that was the change that people voted for in 2016.  And that was the change that people voted for again, powerfully in 2019.  And to deliver that change, we will get on with our job of uniting and levelling up across the UK, the greatest project that any government can embark on.  We have one of the most imbalanced societies and lopsided economies of all the richer countries.  It’s not just that there’s a gap between London and the Southeast and the rest of the country, there are aching gaps within the regions themselves. 

Boris:

What monkey glands are they applying in Ribble Valley? What royal jelly are they eating, that they live seven years longer than the people of Blackpool, only 33 miles away? Why does half of York’s population boast a degree and only a quarter of Doncaster’s? That is not just a question of social justice, it is an appalling waste of potential.  And it is holding this country back.  Because there is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others, or why people should feel they have to move away from their loved ones or communities to reach their potential.  When Thomas Gray stood in that country churchyard in 1750 and wrote his famous elegy as the curfew toll the knell of parting day, he lamented the wasted talents of those buried around him, the flowers born to blush unseen, the mute inglorious Miltons, who never wrote a poem because they never got to read.  The simple folk who died illiterate and enumerate.  And he knew that that was an injustice.  Let me ask you, maybe you know, where was he standing when he chewed his pensive quill? Anybody know? Correct. 

Boris:

My friends, there may be underprivileged parts of our country, but Stoke Poges is not now among them.  In fact, it was only recently determined by the Daily Telegraph, if you can’t believe that, what can you believe, my friends, to be the eighth richest village in England.  Since Gray eulogised, Buckinghamshire has levelled up to be among the most productive regions in the whole of Europe.  Stoke Poges may still, of course, have its problems, but they are overwhelmingly caused by the sheer lust of other people to live in or near Stoke Poges.  Overcrowded trains, endless commutes, too little time with the kids, the constant anxiety that your immemorial view of chalk downland is going be desecrated by ugly new homes.  That is why levelling up works for the whole country, and it is the right and responsible policy because it helps to take the pressure off parts of the overheating Southeast while simultaneously offering hope and opportunity to those areas that have felt left behind. 

Boris:

Let’s be clear that there is a huge philosophical difference between us and Labour, because in their souls, they don’t like levelling up.  They don’t like levelling up.  They like levelling down.  They do.  They like decapitating the tour poppies and taxing the rich till the pips squeak, and they dislike academic competition.  Latin, I hear.  In Islington, I kid you not, I’ve seen it with my own eyes, they like kids to run races, I’ve seen this, where nobody actually wins.  I have to tell you, I don’t think that is a good preparation for life, let alone for the Olympic games.  

Boris:

If you insist on the economic theory behind levelling up, it’s contained in the inside of Vilfredo Pareto, a 19th-century Italian figure who floated from the cobwebbed attic of my memories.  “There are all kinds of improvements that you can make to people’s lives,” he said, “without diminishing everyone else. ” Rishi will, I’m sure, confirm this.  We call these “Pareto improvements,” right? They are the means of levelling up.  The idea in a nutshell is that you will find talent, genius, flare, imagination, enthusiasm everywhere in this country, all of them evenly distributed, evenly distributed, but opportunity is not.  And it is our mission as Conservatives to promote opportunity with every tool we have.  It is still a grim fact that in this country.  That’s right.  It’s all about opportunity.  But it’s still a grim fact that in this country, some kids will grow up in neighborhoods that are much safer than others, and some will be as, as [Pretty 00:16:20] was saying, some will be sucked into gangs, some will be at risk of stabbing and shooting, some will get themselves caught in the one-way ratchet of the criminal justice system.  Many others will not.  That’s why levelling up means fighting crime, putting more police out on the beat, as we are, toughening sentences, rolling up the county lines, drugs networks, as we are, 1,100 of them gone already, giving the police the power they need to fight these dealers in death and misery.  That’s what we want to do.  What’s labor’s answer, by the way? To decriminalise hard drugs, apparently, to let the gangsters off with a caution.  An answer that is straight from the powder rooms of North London dinner parties and nothing to do with the real needs of this country. 

Boris:

Crime has been falling.  Not just, by the way, because we took the precaution of locking up the public for much of the last 18 months, but because you have a Conservative government that understands the Broken Windows theory of fighting crime.  I read a learned article by some lawyer saying we shouldn’t bother about pet theft.  Pet theft.  Well, I say to Cruella Deville, QC, if you can steal a dog or a cat, then there is frankly no limit to your depravity.  Those people gluing themselves to roads, I don’t call them legitimate protestors, like some Labour counsellors do.  I think that some Labour counsellors actually glue themselves to roads.  I say, they are a confounded nuisance who are blocking ambulances, stopping people going about their daily lives, and I’m glad Pretty is taking new powers to insulate them snugly in prison where they belong. 

Boris:

What I find most incredible of all was the decision by Labour, now led by lefty Islington lawyers, to vote against tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders.  On behalf of the entire government, I tell you this, we will not rest until we have increased the successful prosecutions for rape, because too many lying, bullying, cowardly men are using the laws delay to get away with violence against women.  And we cannot, and we will not stand for it.  I know that there are some who tell us that we’re being ungenerous and unfeeling in our attempts to control our borders.  I say, don’t give me that, this is the government that stood up to China and announced that we would provide a haven for British overseas nationals from Hong Kong.  30,000 have already applied.  I’m really proud to be part of a Conservative government that will welcome 20,000 Afghans, people who risked their lives to guide and translate for us.  We are doing the right and responsible thing. 

Boris:

Speaking as the great grandson of a Turk who fled in fear of his life, I know that this country is a beacon of light and hope for people around the world, provided they come here legally.  Provided we understand who they are and what they want to contribute.  That’s why we took back control of our borders and will pass the Borders bill, because we believe there must be a distinction between someone who comes here legally and someone who doesn’t.  And though I have every sympathy with people genuinely in fear of their lives, I have no sympathy whatever with the people traffickers who take thousands of pounds to send children to sea in frail and dangerous craft and we must end this lethal trade.  We must break the gangsters’ business model.  Is it not a sublime irony that even in French politics there is now a leading centre right politician calling for a referendum on the EU, who is now calling for France.  It’s good old Michel Barnier.  That’s what happens if you spend a year trying to argue with Lord Frost, the greatest Frost since the great frost of 1709.  We will fight these gangs at home in abroad because their victims are invariably the poorest and the neediest. 

Boris:

I’ll tell you what levelling up is.  A few years ago, they started a school not far from the Olympic Park.  A new school anyone could send their kids to in an area that for decades has been one of the most disadvantaged in London.  That school is Brampton Manor Academy, and it now sends more kids to Oxbridge than Eton.  If you want proof of what I mean by unleashing potential and by levelling up, look at Brampton Manor.  We can do it.  There is absolutely no reason why the kids of this country should lag behind and why so many should be unable to read or write or do basic mathematics at 11.  To level up, on top of the extra 14 billion we’re putting into education, on top of the increase that means every teacher starts with a salary of 30,000 pounds, we’re announcing today a levelling up premium of up to 3,000 pounds to send the best maths and science teachers to the places that need the most. 

Boris:

Above all, we’re investing in our skills.  Skills, folks.  Our universities are world beating.  I owe everything to my tutors.  They’re one of the great glories of our economy.  But we all know that some of the most brilliant, imaginative and creative people in Britain, some of the best-paid people in Britain, did not go to university.  To level up, you need to give people the options, the skills, that are right for them.  To make the most of those skills and knowledge, you need urgently to plug all the other gaps in the infrastructure that are still holding people and communities back. 

Boris:

Transport is one of the supreme leveller uppers, and we are making the big generational changes shirked by previous governments.  We will do northern powerhouse rail.  We will link up the cities of the Midlands of the north.  We will restore those sinews of the union that have been allowed to atrophy: The A1 north of Berwick and on into Scotland, the A75 in Scotland that is so vital for the links with Northern Ireland and the rest of the country, the North Wales corridor.  Yes.  And we will invest in our roads, unblocking, those coagulated, roundabouts and steering wheel bending traffic lights.  We’re putting on 4,000 more clean, green buses made in this country, some of them running on hydrogen. 

Boris:

The great ambition of the human race, that the left always privately share but publicly disparage.  And we can do it.  Look at this country from the air, go on Google Maps.  You see how our landscape has been plotted and pieced and jigsawed together by centuries of bequests and litigation, a vast testament to security of titled trust in the law.  And it’s a confidence that is responsible for so much international investment.  You see how rich this country is growing, the billions of loving and incremental improvements to homes and gardens. 

Boris:

Build back beaver, I say.  Build back beaver.  Though the beavers may sometimes build without local authority permission, you can also see how much room there is to build the homes that young families need in this country.  Not on green fields, not just jammed in the Southeast, but beautiful homes on Brownfield sites in places where homes make sense. 

Boris:

There is no happiness like taking a set of keys and knowing the place is yours.  And you can paint the front door any colour you like.  As it happens, I can’t paint my own front door any colour I like.  It has to be black, but I certainly don’t have to go very far to work.  And if you don’t have to go far to work and your commute isn’t too dreadful, and if the job suits your skills and your wifi is fast and reliable, I’ll tell you something else, that housing in the right place and at an affordable price will add massively, not just to your general joie de vivre, but to your productivity. 

Boris:

And remember Labour’s performance during the pandemic, flapping with all the conviction of a damp tea towel.  They refused to say that schools were safe.  They would’ve kept us and the European medicines agents and slammed the brakes on the vaccine rollout.  The Labour leader attacked the Vaccine Task Force for spending money on outreach to vaccine-hesitant minority groups, when it’s hard to think of any better use of public money.  And let’s forgive him, on the basis that he probably didn’t know what he was talking about. 

Boris:

He opposed step four of the roadmap in July.  Remember? That’s right, folks, if we listened to Captain Hindsight today, we’d still be in lockdown.  We wouldn’t have the fastest growth in the G7.  If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he’d be famous for having discovered Tenerife.  How utterly astonishing, how utterly astonishing.  How utterly astonishing that in the last few weeks, Labour should actually have voted against the funding we’re putting forward for the NHS. Boris:

Boris:

Gene editing, data management, AI, cyber, quantum, and we’re going to be ever more global in our outlook.  We’ve done already 68 free trade deals, including that great free trade deal with our friends in the EU, which they all say was impossible.  And after decades of bewildering refusal, we have persuaded the Americans to import prime British beef, a market already worth 66 million pounds.  Build back burger, I say.  And you ask yourself, how have the Americans been able to survive without British beef for so long?

Boris:

If you want a supreme example of global Britain in action, of something daring and brilliant, that would simply not have happened if we’d remained in the EU, I give you AUKUS.  AUKUS, an idea so transparently right that Labour Conference voted overwhelmingly against it.  And I know there has been a certain raucus caucus from the anti-AUKUS caucus, but AUKUS is simply a recognition of the reality that the world is tilting on its axis, on its economic axis. 

Boris:

Our trade and relations in the Indo-Pacific region are becoming more vital than ever before.  That’s why we sent our amazing carrier strike group to the Far East, performing maneuvers with 40 friendly countries, HMS Queen Elizabeth, as long as the entire palace of Westminster, and rather more compelling as an argument than many of the speeches made in the House of Commons, it has dozens of F-35s on board, 66,000 sausages, and not because we want to threaten anyone or be adversarial to anyone, either with the F-35s or indeed, the sausages, but because we want to stick up for the rule of law that is so vital for freedom of navigation and free trade.  And that’s what brings AUKUS together.  Australia, UK, US, shared values, a shared belief in democracy and human rights, a shared belief in the equal dignity and worth of every human being.  Very few countries could have pulled off the Kabul airlift, an astonishing feat by our brave Armed Forces. 

Boris:

We’re led by our values, by the things we stand for.  And we should never forget that people around the world admire this country for its history and traditions.  And they love the groovy new architecture and the fashion and the music and all the rest of it.  The chance of meeting the … Michael in the disco.  But they like it for the way it emerges organically.  The way all that emerges organically from a vast inherited conglomerate of culture and tradition. 

Boris:

I believe that through history and accident, this country has a unique spirit, the spirit of the NHS nurses, and the entrepreneurs whose innovative flare means that there are three countries in the world that have produced more than 100 unicorns.  You know what I mean by a unicorn? It’s not a mythical beast.  It’s a tech company worth more than a billion dollars each.  And those three countries, have you been paying attention? They are the United States, China and the United Kingdom.  And those unicorns are now dispersed around the United Kingdom in a way that is new to our country.  It’s fantastic to see that levelling up. 

Boris:

Gentlemen, thank you to all of you, you faithful few, who have waited to the end of this very, very important session, and very good to see my audience over there.  Listen folks, an inspection of the fossil record over the last 178 million years, which is since mammals first appeared, reveals that the average mammalian species, we’re all mammals, exists for about a million years before it evolves into something else, or else vanishes into extinction.  And of our allotted lifespan of a million years, humanity, homosapiens, has been around for about 200,000 years.  In other words, we’re still collectively a youngster.  If you imagine that million years is the lifespan of an individual human being, about 80 years, then we’re now sweet 16.  We’ve come to that fateful age when we know roughly how to drive, and we know how to unlock the drinks cabinet and to engage in all sorts of activity that is not only potentially embarrassing, but also terminal for ourselves and others. 

Boris:

In the words of the Oxford philosopher, Toby Ord, “We’re just old enough to get ourselves into serious trouble. ” And I’m afraid we believe, we still cling with parts of our minds to the infantile belief that the world was made for our gratification and pleasure.  And we combine this narcissism with an assumption of our own immortality.  We believe that someone else will clear up the mess because that is what someone else has always done.  And we trash our habitats again and again with the inductive reasoning that we’ve got away with it so far and therefore we’ll get away with it again. 

Boris:

My friends, the adolescence of humanity is coming to an end and must come to an end.  We’re approaching that critical turning point in less than two months, in just over 40 days, when we must show that we are capable of learning and maturing and finally taking responsibility for the destruction we are inflicting not just upon our planet, but upon ourselves. 

Boris:

It’s time for humanity to grow up.  It’s time for us to listen to the warnings of the scientists.  And if you look at COVID, if you want to see an example of the gloomy scientist being proved right, it’s time for us to grow up and understand who we are and what we’re doing.  The world, this precious blue sphere with its eggshell crust and wisp of an atmosphere, is not some indestructible toy, some bouncy plastic romper room against which we can hurl ourselves to our hearts content.  Daily, weekly, we are doing such irreversible damage that long before a million years are up, we will have made this beautiful planet effectively uninhabitable, not just for us, but for many other species.  And that is why the Glasgow COP26 Summit is the turning point for humanity. 

Boris: 

It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime. And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense. And though we grieve for all those we have lost. It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants. And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children. So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening. I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates. And though it is right to be flexible in our response. I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress could. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection. We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago. And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels. Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0. 5 and 0. 9 – but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given. We have by no means fulfilled all of them. And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work.  So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle.  But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them. And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further. In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays.  And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.  We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health. And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.  It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down. And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes. We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already. The patience and common sense you have shown. The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can. The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers. The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease. Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more. The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine. When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country. And that have helped to get us through this first phase. I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. And if we can’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right. We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.  More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing. But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Thank you very much. 

Boris:

Good afternoon.  I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted.  I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor.  and her deep sense of public service.  but in spite of all her efforts it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad.  who think that after three years of indecision.  that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016.  and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate.  And so I am standing before you today to tell you.  the British people.  that those critics are wrong.  The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters – they are going to get it wrong again.  The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts.  because we are going to restore trust in our democracy.  and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31.  no ifs or buts.  and we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe.  based on free trade and mutual support.  I have every confidence that in 99 days’ time we will have cracked it.  but you know what – we aren’t going to wait 99 days.  because the British people have had enough of waiting.  The time has come to act,.  to take decisions.  to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better.  and though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state.  my job is to serve you, the people.  because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses.  My job is to make your streets safer – and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets.  and we start recruiting forthwith.  My job is to make sure you don’t have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP.  and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line.  My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care.  and so I am announcing now – on the steps of Downing Street – that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared.  to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.  My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education.  wherever they are in the country.  and that’s why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools.  and that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door.  and though I am today building a great team of men and women I will take personal responsibility.  for the change I want to see.  Never mind the backstop – the buck stops here.  And I will tell you something else about my job. .  It is to be Prime Minister of the whole United Kingdom.  and that means uniting our country.  answering at last the plea of the forgotten people.  and the left behind towns.  by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together.  so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband.  we level up across Britain.  with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity.  we close the opportunity gap.  giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes.  and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK.  because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East.  but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  the awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red white and blue flag.  who together are so much more than the sum of their parts.  and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world.  for our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy.  for the equalities on which we insist – whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education.  and for the values we stand for around the world.  Everyone knows the values that flag represents.  It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law.  and above all it stands for democracy.  and that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31.  because in the end Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect.  and they can remove from office.  and we must now respect that decision.  and create a new partnership with our European friends – as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible.  and the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3. 2 m EU nationals now living and working among us.  and I say directly to you – thank you for your contribution to our society.  thank you for your patience and I can assure you that under this government you will get the absolute certainty of the rights.  to live and remain.  And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU.  I am convinced that we can do a deal.  without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks.  and yet without that anti-democratic backstop.  and it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility.  that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate.  and we are forced to come out with no deal.  not because we want that outcome – of course not.  but because it is only common sense to prepare.  and let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted.  and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready.  at some point in the near future.  to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control.  fully determined at last to take advantage of brexit.  because that is the course on which this country is now set.  with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready.  and the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready.  and the factories will be ready.  and business will be ready.  and the hospitals will be ready.  and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling.  ever more not just here but around the world.  and don’t forget that in the event of a no deal outcome we will have the extra lubrication of the £39 bn.  and whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package.  to boost British business and to lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment.  and to all those who continue to prophesy disaster.  I say yes – there will be difficulties.  though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed.  but if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years.  it is not the decisions we have taken.  it is our refusal to take decisions.  and to all those who say we cannot be ready.  I say do not underestimate this country.  Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination.  because we know the enormous strengths of this economy.  in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services,.  It is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness.  here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change.  and produce green jobs for the next generation.  and as we prepare for a post-Brexit future it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us.  so let us begin work now to create freeports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left behind areas.  let’s start now to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti genetic modification rules.  and let’s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world.  let’s get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems – UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country.  Let’s change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research.  and let’s promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people.  and yes, let’s start now on those free trade deals.  because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty.  all this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history.  and after three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to.  change the record.  to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world.  No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country.  They will not succeed today.  We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves.  and that work begins now.  Thank you very much. 



Boris:


It’s great to be back in Warsaw, thank you again Mateusz for your characteristically warm welcome. The reason I’m here is because Poland is absolutely critical to our collective European security and the lesson of the last 100 years is that when Poland is threatened with instability, or aggression on the borders of Poland, then we are all threatened and we’re all affected. And I just want to be absolutely clear, when Poland is threatened then the UK stands ready to help, as indeed Poland has always stood ready to help the United Kingdom. So I’m very pleased again to have the chance to talk to you Mateusz, you’re absolutely right in what you said. Much of what we talked about in November has come to pass and that’s why earlier today the UK’s 45 Commando Unit touched down in Poland. And those 350 troops join the 150 British troops who arrived here in December in response to instability on the Belarusian border, and the 150 British troops who contribute to NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence, are standing shoulder to shoulder with our Polish counterparts to bring stability and security not just to Poland, but to Europe and I would say to the world. I’ve just come from seeing Jens Soltenburg in NATO, where the message I have given, and the one the UK has been giving to all our counterparts, is that we need to work together now to achieve de-escalation and to persuade Vladimir Putin to de-escalate and to disengage. And as we tirelessly pursue the path of diplomacy to bring an end to the tensions on Ukrainian borders, it is important to remember why we are doing this and why we’re putting together this package of sanctions against a possible invasion, why we’re doing so much to support and protect Ukraine. And it’s exactly as Mateusz has just said - we won’t accept, Poland and the UK won’t accept, a world in which a powerful neighbour can bully or attack their neighbours. And we won’t accept it because we believe all people – no matter where they are born – have a right to live safely, choose who governs them and to decide what organisations they aspire to have membership of. Or, indeed, what bodies they want to cease being members of. And we will not compromise on that principle. It’s now more than 80 years Mateusz since Polish pilots came to my own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in West London to help my country in our fight for freedom. We stood side by side to uphold our values and our principles then, and we stand side by side today. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Previous waves of the pandemic did not have a single day with more than 100,000 new cases reported. On one day last week we had 200,000 people test positive. And the latest figure today is another 218,000, though that includes some delayed reports. So anyone who thinks our battle with Covid is over is, I’m afraid, profoundly wrong. This is a moment for the utmost caution. But our position today differs from previous waves in two crucial respects. First, we now know that Omicron is milder than previous variants, so while hospital admissions are rising quickly with over 15,000 Covid patients now in hospital in England alone - this is not yet, thankfully, translating into the same numbers needing intensive care that we saw in previous waves. And second, thanks to the fantastic national effort to get Britain boosted, we now have a substantial level of protection, higher than any of our European neighbours, with over 34 million boosters administered, including in England reaching more than 90 per cent of the over-70s, and 86 per cent of the over-50s. And so together with the Plan B measures that we introduced before Christmas, we have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again. We can keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus. But the weeks ahead are going to be challenging, both here in the UK and across the world. There is no escaping the fact that some services will be disrupted by staff absences, but we have been working through Christmas to prepare for this wherever possible. And if we all play our part in containing the spread of this virus the disruptions we face can be far less severe than a national lockdown, with all the devastation that would bring for livelihoods and the life chances of our children. So the government is acting to protect critical national services, keep supply chains open, and fortify our NHS to withstand the pressures ahead. We’ve identified 100,000 critical workers, in areas from food processing to transport to our border force - and from 10 January we’ll be rolling out lateral flow testing for all these workers, available on every working day. We’ll be sending testing kits directly to these organisations and liaising with them on the logistics. We’ve asked qualified teachers who have left the profession to come back and help fill temporary absences, and I want to thank them and all teachers, parents and pupils for taking the precaution to test yourselves and to wear a mask in the classroom, enabling vital face-to-face education to continue. We’re increasing NHS capacity by building onsite Nightingale hospitals, as well as creating 2,500 virtual beds where people can be safely treated at home. We’ve bought more antivirals per person than anywhere else in Europe those are the tablets which reduce your chances of going to hospital once you’ve caught Covid. We’re mobilising our volunteers – the emerging territorial army of the NHS – and we’re working to identify those NHS Trusts which are most likely to need actual military support, so this can be prepared now. As our NHS moves to a war footing, I will be recommending to Cabinet tomorrow that we continue with Plan B, because the public have responded and changed their behaviour, your behaviour, buying valuable time to get boosters in arms and help the NHS to cope with the Omicron wave. So please carry on observing those measures for now. Work from home if you can. Wear face coverings on public transport and in indoor public places, and take a test before you go to a high-risk venue or meet those who are elderly or vulnerable. And follow the relevant rules if you live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Above all, if you haven’t already done so please, please get that booster. Since I launched the Get Boosted Now campaign on 12 December: we have delivered 10 million extra boosters across the UK; we have doubled the rate of vaccination from 450,000 doses a day to a peak of more than 900,000; we matched the NHS’s previous record day, and then beat it again and again; and we met our target of offering a booster to every eligible adult a whole month early. The freedoms we are able to maintain in the teeth of this Omicron wave have been made possible by the number of people getting boosted, and I want to thank again, everyone who assisted this extraordinary national effort over Christmas. Our GPs and their teams, pharmacists and everyone in our fantastic NHS, the thousands of volunteers, the ingenious initiatives of local communities, like the one in Redbridge Town Hall which vaccinated 1,700 people on Christmas Day - and every one of you who has come forward and done your bit by getting jabbed. But there are still almost 9 million people eligible, who haven’t had their booster, And it’s absolutely heart-breaking that as many as 90 per cent of those in intensive care with Covid have not had their booster, and over 60 per cent of those in Intensive Care, who have Covid, have not had any vaccination at all. People are dying needlessly because they haven’t had their jabs, they haven’t had that booster. And there are 2 million booster slots available this week alone. It’s already the case that to travel to some countries you need a booster to be considered fully vaccinated, and it’s likely that within weeks this will increasingly become the norm. So if you haven’t done it already, get yourself boosted this month. Exactly a year after the UK administered the first AstraZeneca vaccine, a British invention that has enabled 2.5 billion jabs around the world - the best way to contain this virus, help our NHS, and keep our country open, is to get boosted, and so please, Get Boosted Now. 

Boris:


When NATO was founded more than 75 years ago, its members made a commitment to collective security that was unlike anything in previous history. And when the Berlin Wall fell the people of Europe made it clear they wanted a future where their freedom and their security are inextricably tied together. That is why NATO agreed that any country should be free to pursue the security alliances that it, that country chose. And we must resist, we must oppose any return to the days when the fates of nations are decided over their heads by a handful of great powers. And I want to stress this is not just about Russia, just as NATO itself is not just about Russia, of course not. This is about upholding the founding principles of an alliance which, perhaps more than any other institution, has brought stability and peace, prosperity to the world. And that must be the bedrock of our diplomatic efforts. The UK’s commitment to European security is unconditional and immovable. We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO. We have contributed more troops than any other ally to NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence. And today I have agreed with the Secretary General a package of support to strengthen further our collective security, sending troops, planes and ships to defend NATO from north to south. Earlier this week I met the Prime Minister of Lithuania and I will be travelling shortly to Poland. And these are the countries where every day the population wakes up with an acute awareness of the threat just across their border. And they are countries whose voices and views must be at the heart of every discussion we have. Because I believe that if we can keep a strong grip on the fundamentals, those fundamental principles that define our alliance and combine strong deterrence with patient diplomacy, then we can find our way through this crisis. But the stakes are very high and this is a very dangerous moment. And at stake are the rules that protect every nation, every nation – big and small. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Great to be here in Tyneside, the number one exporting region of the UK. Great to be with the CBI. And I want to begin with a massive thank you to British business. For keeping going. For looking after your employees. For rising to the challenge. For responding to the call for ventilators in those first dark days. Dozens of you, Kitchen appliance makers, Hairdryer makers, Formula one motor car manufacturers, Turning your production lines over in days to try to save lives. For making the masks and the gowns and the gloves at such speed. Turning things round from that awful moment when we realised we simply didn’t have the domestic production. So we have gone from being able to supply 1 per cent of our domestic needs to 80 per cent. And thank you British industry, enterprise, commerce, For producing not just one but perhaps half a dozen vaccines. Because without you, let’s face it, we would simply not be here, And nor would tens of thousands of people in our country and millions around the world, Who owe their lives to your resourcefulness and inventiveness. And while I’m on the subject, can I ask who has had your booster? You all look far too young and thrusting to need a booster but get your booster as soon as you can. Because it is by vaccinating our country that we have been able to get your staff back to their place of work, to open our theatres, our restaurants and to get back for longer now than any other comparator country to something like normal life. Even if we are still bumping elbows and wearing masks. I am not going to pretend that everything is going to be plain sailing. We can see the state of the pandemic abroad. The supply chain issues that we’re facing. The pressure on energy prices that we’re all facing. The skills shortages. But don’t forget folks, my friends, it was only last year they were saying we would have an unemployment crisis now on the scale not seen since the 1980s or 1990s. They were forecasting 12 per cent unemployment. And what have we got? Thanks to you, thanks to the resilience of British business, we have employment back in work at pre-pandemic levels. It was only last year that we experienced the biggest fall in output in a century. As we were forced to lock down the economy. Well look at us now. Thanks to you and thanks to British business bouncebackability, we are forecast to have the fastest economic growth in the G7. And I was there in the 70s and 80s and 90s. And I remember mass unemployment. And the misery and the drain of the human spirit. And I would much rather have our problems today – which are fundamentally caused by a return in global confidence and a surge in demand. Because now we have a massive opportunity to fix these supply-side problems. To transform whole sectors of our economy and to tackle the chronic problems underlying the UK economy. The woeful imbalance in productivity across the country. But also the imbalance between British business. Between the go-getting world-beaters represented by so many people in this room, And the long comet tail whose potential is frankly yet to be realised. That don’t have the skills – particularly the IT skills – as Rishi the Chancellor so often points out. That don’t have the banks behind them, that don’t have the investment. And that is the mission of this country – to unite and level up. Of this government – to unite and level up across the whole country. And I’ve got to be honest with you, it is a moral mission. As you get older, the funny thing is you get more idealistic and less cynical. It’s a moral thing, but it is also an economic imperative. Because if this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, And if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, Then there would be absolutely no stopping us. And we would achieve what I believe we can. And become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe. And today fate has handed us an opportunity to do that. When the first industrial revolution began 250 years ago it was British industry that had first-mover advantage. For hundreds of years, we maintained that pace. Right up until the beginning of the 20th century we were producing more coal, smelting more iron, building more ships and boilers and making more machines than virtually any other country on earth. And today we are on the brink of another revolution. A green industrial revolution. And again there are many ways in which we have first-mover advantage. And today I want to tell you in the CBI how Britain is going to win in the new green industrial revolution. Provided we act and act now. I have had some pretty wonderful jobs in my life, but among the most purely hedonistic I would rank motoring correspondent of GQ magazine. I drove: 
Ferraris
Maseratis
Nissan Skylines
Proton Sagas

You name it, I drove it. And I learned to admire the incredible diversity of the UK specialist motor manufacturing sector, which is actually the biggest in the world. And I have spent hours in the traffic, listening to the porridge-like burble and pop of the biggest and most sophisticated internal combustion engines ever made. And I have heard that burble turn into an operatic roar as I have put my foot down and burned away from the lights at speeds I would not now confess to my protection officers. In that time, that great era, I only tried two EVs – electric vehicles. An extraordinary wheeled rabbit hutch that was so tiny you could park it sideways. And I tried the first Tesla for sale in this country, for GQ, that expired in the fast lane of the M40. They’ve got a lot better. And when a few years later as Mayor of London I tried to get London motorists to go electric and we put in charging points around the city, I must confess that they were not then a soaraway success. And they stood forlorn like some piece of unused outdoor gym equipment. But ten years after that – the tipping point has come, hasn’t it? UK sales of EVs are now increasing at 70 per cent a year. And in 2030 we are ending the market for new hydrocarbon ICEs, ahead of other European countries. And companies are responding. Here in the north east, Nissan has decided to make an enormous bet on new electric vehicles and together with Envision there is now a massive new gigafactory for batteries. And around the world, these cars are getting ever more affordable. And at Glasgow two weeks ago the tipping point came, as motor manufacturers representing a third of the world market – including the EU and America – announced that they would go electric by 2035. And of course, Glasgow was far bigger and more important than that. 250 years after we launched the first industrial revolution, we are showing the world how to power past coal. When I was a kid, 80 per cent of our electricity came from coal. And I remember those huge barges taking coal up the Thames to Battersea power station and those four chimneys belching fumes into the face and lungs of the city. By the time I became mayor, Battersea was a wreck. Closed for being simply too polluting. And good for nothing except the final shoot out in gangster movies. But in 2012, we were still 40 per cent dependent on coal. Today – only ten years later – coal supplies less than 2 per cent of our power. And by 2024 it will be down to zero And Battersea of course is a great funkapolitan hive of cafes and restaurants and hotels and homes Thanks to the vision of the former Mayor. And every time I made that point to leaders in Glasgow, About the speed of the switch that we’ve made from coal, I could see them thinking about it and I could see them thinking: right, ok, maybe this is doable. And when I was a kid literally zero per cent of our energy came from wind. And it seemed faddish and ludicrous to imagine that we could light and heat our homes with a technology that dated from 9th century Persia, I think. And yet today – look at the coast of the north east where we are today. Row after row stretching out to the north sea, of beautiful white mills as we claim a new harvest, Rich and green from the drowned meadows of doggerland. And on some days we derive almost half this country’s energy needs, With the biggest offshore wind production anywhere in the world – and growing the whole time. And that tipping point having been reached, the pace of change is now going to accelerate like new a Tesla. Because I can tell you as a former motoring correspondent, EVs may not burble like sucking doves, and
they may not have that arum arum araaaaaagh that you love, But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari. And we are now embarked on a new epoch. And in just a few years’ time, after almost a century of using roughly the same technology, we are going to change radically. We are going to change radically: 
our cars
our trucks
our buses
our ships
our boats
our planes
our trains
our domestic heating systems
our farming methods
our industrial processes
our power generation

And much else besides. And I can tell you the force driving that change. It won’t be government, and it won’t even be business – though business and government together will have a massive influence. It will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, The disciples of David Attenborough, Not just in this country but around the world, Who can see the consequences of climate change and who will be demanding better from us. And I confidently predict that in just a few years’ time it will be as noisome, offensive to the global consumer to open a new coal fired power station as it is to get on a plane and light up a cigar. And as the world reaches this pivotal moment, post Glasgow, it’s vital that we recognise not just the scale of the challenge, but the opportunity now for British business and industry. Because in the end it is you, it is business people, who will fix this problem. Governments don’t innovate. Governments don’t produce new products and get out and sell them in the market place. And though governments can sell, governments can spend tens if not hundreds of billions, We know that the market has hundreds of trillions. And yet we also know that government has a vital role in making that market, and in framing the right regulation. And to ensure that you, the British business succeeds in this new world, we have set out a ten point plan for government leadership. A new Decalogue that I produced exactly a year ago, when I came down from Sinai and I said to my officials the new ten commandments thou shalt develop: Offshore wind. Hydrogen. Nuclear power. Zero emission vehicles. Green public transport, cycling and walking. ‘Jet zero’ and green ships 7: greener buildings 8: carbon capture and storage 9: nature and trees 10: green finance And for each of those objectives we are producing a roadmap, so that you in the private sector can see the opportunities ahead and what you need to do. And we are regulating so as to require new homes and buildings to have EV charging points – with another 145,000 charging points to be installed thanks to these regulations. We are investing in new projects to turn wind power into hydrogen. And the net zero strategy is expected to trigger about £90 billion of private sector investment, driving the creation of high wage high skill jobs across the UK, as part of our mission to unite and level up across the country. Not just in the green industrial revolution of course, but in all sectors of the economy. And to help you, and to build the platform, to give you the advantage you need, we are now waging a cross-Whitehall campaign to solve our productivity puzzle and to rebalance our lopsided economy. Fixing our infrastructure with investment on a scale not seen since the Victorians. And we must begin with energy and power generation, if we are going to have, allow, our manufacturing industry to succeed, we must end the unfairness that UK, high energy-intensive manufacturing pays so much more than our competitors overseas. And that’s why we are going to address the cost of our nuclear power and we are all now paying for the historic under under-investment in nuclear power. Which country first split the atom? Which country had the first civilian nuclear power plant? It was this one. And why have we allowed ourselves to be left behind? Well, you tell me. So we are investing not just in big new nuclear plants but in small nuclear reactors as well. And we are consulting on classifying this essential technology as “green investment”, so that we can get more investment flowing in and ahead of the EU. Lenin once said that the communist revolution was soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country. Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin, Tony, before the CBI, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country. We are electrifying our cars, we are electrifying our rail. Last week we announced three vast new high speed lines. Cutting the time from London to Manchester by an hour. And creating a new Crossrail of the north Cutting the time from Manchester to Leeds from 55 to 33 minutes. A crossrail for the Midlands, Cutting journey times from Birmingham to Nottingham from one hour and 14 minutes to 26 minutes. But these plans are far richer and more ambitious than some of the coverage has perhaps suggested. To solve this country’s transport problems, you can’t just endlessly carve your way through virgin countryside. You have to upgrade, and to electrify. You have to use the tracks that already exist and bring them back into service. And we are doing the Beeching reversals – that’s putting in lines that were taken out sadly in the last century. You have to put other transport networks as well. You have to put in clean buses, you have to improve, 4000 new clean green buses we’re putting in. And of course, you have to fix the roads as well. We cannot be endlessly hostile to road improvements. And we have to do it now, we have to fix it now. I know that there are some people who think that working habits have been remade by the pandemic, and that everyone will be working only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, in an acronym I won’t repeat. I don’t want to be dogmatic about this, but I have my doubts. And it is not just that young people need to be in the office to learn, and to compete, and to pick up social capital. There are also sound evolutionary reasons why mother nature does not like working from home. So I people prophesy that people will come back, Tony – they will come to the office. And they will come back on the roads and the rail. But people also want choice. And that is why we must put in the gigabit broadband – as we are – which has gone up massively just in the last couple of years from 7 per cent when I became PM to 65 per cent at the beginning of next year. And with safer streets, With great local schools, With fantastic broadband, People will have the confidence to stay nearer the place they grew up. To start business. And business will have the confidence to invest. And then of course there is one thing that business wants and that this country needs, Far more than a hundred supersonic rail links, Far more than broadband, And that is skills. And the people that you all need to staff your business. It’s an astonishing fact that the 16-18 year olds in this country are getting 40% less time and instruction than our competitors in the OECD, and so we’re turning that round. We are focusing on skills, skills, skills, Investing in our FE colleges, our apprentices, in the knowhow and confidence of young people. And since, as everybody knows, 80 per cent of the 2030 workforce are already in work, We are giving every adult who needs it the chance to get a level three skill. £3000 for a lifetime skills guarantee. We are supporting bootcamps for everything from IT to entrepreneurship. And at this pivotal moment in our economic history, we are taking advantage of our new freedoms. To deliver freeports as well as free trade deals. And to regulate differently and better, To lengthen our lead in all the amazing new technologies of the 21st century: 
AI
cyber
quantum computing

And all the rest and all the applications of those technologies to the areas in which we excel. So you get fin tech, ed tech, bio tech, med tech, nano tech, ag tech, green tech, So you sound basically like 15th century Mexico. And that is what this country is doing There are only 3 countries that have produced more than 100 tech unicorns and they are, as you will know, well which are they? Let’s see who’s been paying attention to any of my speeches in the last few … which 3 nations have produced more than 100 tech unicorns? Correct. They are the US, China and the UK And the wonderful thing about the more than the 100 tech unicorns is they are dispersed now far more evenly across the whole of the UK than the tech unicorns of some of our rival competitor economies. And that is a fantastic thing. We want to see the dispersal of this growth and development across the UK. That’s why this government has doubled investment in scientific research – and again, we want to see the benefits of that research across the whole of the country But in the end And this is the most important message of all. There are limits to what governments can do. And I just want to be absolutely clear about this – because this has been an extraordinary period. There has been the financial crisis of 2008, where government had to intervene on a massive scale. Then Covid, when government had to intervene on a massive scale. But government cannot fix everything and government sometimes should get out of your hair. And government should make sure there is less regulation and indeed less taxation. And the true driver of growth is not government, it is the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector And Tony, yesterday, I went as we all must to Peppa Pig World. Hands up if you’ve been to Peppa Pig World – [not enough] I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. It had very safe streets. Discipline in schools. Heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems, I noticed. Even if they are a bit stereotypical about daddy pig. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer, or possibly a sort of Picasso-like hairdryer, A pig that was rejected by the BBC, Would now be exported to 180 countries, With theme parks both in America and in China as well as in the New Forest, And a business that is worth at least £6bn to this country, £6bn and counting. I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant in the world, could conceivably have come up with Peppa. So my final message to you. As we stand on the brink of this green industrial revolution. As we prepare to use our new regulatory freedoms in what I believe will be a very strong post-Covid rebound. We are blessed, We are blessed not just with capital markets and the world’s best universities and incredible pools of liquidity in London, the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, We are also blessed with the amazing inventive power and range of British business. And that above all is what fills me with confidence, members of the CBI, for the days ahead. Thank you very much for your kind attention this morning, thank you. 

Boris:


Standing on a Cornish beach with President Macron last summer, one could not help but be struck by the majesty of the ocean before us, and its importance to all our lives. Because the nations of the world are not separated by seas and oceans – we are bound together by them. Whatever our stage of development, whatever our system of government, the same briny waters lap at all our shores. And we all have a duty to help them thrive. It’s a duty the UK takes extremely seriously. It’s why we’ve committed half a billion pounds to help developing nations protect their seas and coasts. Why we’ve thrown a Blue Belt around 2.5 million square miles of ocean. And why, I can announce today, the UK will be joining the High Ambition Coalition on Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction. Because it’s vital that we all step up and meet our obligations to the marine environment under the Convention on the Law of the Sea. And that won’t happen unless we agree a treaty to protect the vast expanse of water – something like 60 per cent of it – that falls beyond the borders of any one nation. At COP26, I stressed the need for the world to raise its ambitions with respect to our oceans. So I’m delighted that President Macron has convened this summit. And I hope it kicks off a year in which the world comes together in support of the seas that surround us, the flora and fauna within, and everyone around the world whose livelihoods depend on thriving, clean, and sustainable oceans. 

Boris:


Thank you very much President Zelenskyy and thank you for welcoming us all to your Mariyinski palace here, it’s absolutely fantastic to be back in Kyiv and to see the excitement, the buzz of this capital which has changed a lot since I was last here five years ago, in many interesting and positive ways. But we have to face a grim reality which is that as we stand here today Volodmyr, more than 100,000 Russian troops are gathering on your border in perhaps the biggest demonstration of hostility towards Ukraine in our lifetimes. And the potential deployment dwarves the 30,000 troops Russia sent to invade Crimea in 2014. Since that time of course, as everybody knows, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed and Ukraine has been plunged into nearly a decade of war. It goes without saying that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a political disaster, a humanitarian disaster, in my view would also be, for Russia, for the world, a military disaster as well. And the potential invasion completely flies in the face of President Putin’s claims to be acting in the interest of the Ukrainian people. The UK and other countries will be judged, by the people of the Ukraine and the world, on how we respond and how we help. Since 2015 the UK has trained over 22,000 Ukrainian military personnel and provided £2.2 million worth of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine. Two weeks ago we sent anti-tank weaponry to strengthen Ukraine’s defences further. Today I have announced a further £88 million of UK funding to support good governance and energy independence in Ukraine. This will bolster your efforts Volodmyr, and those of others to build a free and prosperous Ukrainian society, free of malign influences. Alongside other countries we are also preparing a package of sanctions and other measures to be enacted the moment the first Russian toe-cap crosses further into Ukrainian territory. And we have done all this and prepared all this, not as a show of hostility towards Russia, but as a demonstration that we will always stand up for freedom, democracy and Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of aggression. In recent days I have spoken to the leaders of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, the NATO Secretary General and others - all agree on the fundamental importance of supporting Ukraine’s self-determination. Because the people of Ukraine have the inalienable right to choose how they are governed and indeed which organisations they aspire to join. And as your friend and partner, the UK will always uphold that right. It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy and I believe that is still possible. We are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are, we have the sanctions ready, we’re providing military support and we will also intensify our economic co-operation. Because we are a firm and enduring ally of Ukraine and a supporter of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and integrity. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I would like to make a statement. First I want to express my deepest gratitude to Sue Gray, and all the people who have contributed to this report, which I have placed in the Library of this House and the government has published in full today, for everyone to read. I will address its findings in this statement - but firstly I want to say: sorry. Sorry for the things we simply did not get right and sorry for the way that this matter has been handled. It is no use saying that this or that was within the rules. It is no use saying that people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone. We asked people across this country to make the most extraordinary sacrifices, not to meet loved ones, not to visit relatives before they died, and I understand the anger that people feel. But, Mr Speaker, it is not enough to say sorry. This is a moment when we must look at ourselves in the mirror and we must learn. And while the Metropolitan Police must yet complete their investigation - and that means there are no details of specific events in Sue Gray’s report - I, of course, accept Sue Gray’s general findings in full, and above all her recommendation that we must learn from these events and act now. With respect to the events under police investigation, she says - and I quote -  “No conclusions should be drawn, or inferences made from this other than it is now for the police to consider the relevant material in relation to those incidents.” But more broadly she finds that -  “There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.” That is why we are making changes now to the way Downing Street and the Cabinet Office run so that we can get on with the job, the job that I was elected to do and that this government was elected to do. First, it is time to sort out what Sue Gray rightly calls the “fragmented and complicated” leadership structures of Downing Street which she says have not evolved sufficiently to meet the demands of the expansion of Number ten. And we will do that, including by creating an Office of the Prime Minister, with a Permanent Secretary to lead Number ten. Second, Mr Speaker, it is clear from Sue Gray’s report that it is time not just to review the Civil Service and Special Adviser codes of conduct wherever necessary to ensure they take account of Sue Gray’s recommendations but also to make sure those codes are properly enforced. And third, I will be saying more in the coming days about the steps we will take to improve the Number ten operation and the work of the Cabinet Office to strengthen Cabinet Government and to improve the vital connection between Number ten and parliament. Mr Speaker, I get it and I will fix it. And I want to say to the people of this country. I know what the issue is, it is whether this government can be trusted to deliver and I say yes we can be trusted yes we can be trusted to deliver. We said we would deliver Brexit and we did. We are setting up freeports across the whole United Kingdom, I’ve been to one of them today, which is creating tens of thousands of new jobs Mr Speaker. We said we would get this country through Covid and we did, we delivered the fastest vaccine roll out in Europe and the fastest booster programme of any major economy so that we have been able to restore people’s freedoms faster than any comparable economy and at the same time as we have been cutting crime by fourteen per cent and building 40 new hospitals and rolling out gigabit broadband, and delivering on all the other promises of that 2019 agenda so that we have the fastest economic growth in the G7. We have shown that we can do things people thought were impossible and that we can deliver for the British people. The reason we are coming out of Covid so fast is at least partly because we doubled the speed of the booster rollout and I can tell the House and this country, that we are going to bring the same energy and commitment to getting on with the job to delivering for the British people and to our mission to unite and level up across the country. And I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s statement in the House of Commons on Ukraine Mr Speaker, A few weeks ago, I commissioned an independent inquiry into a series of events in Downing Steet, the Cabinet Office as well as some other Whitehall departments that may have constituted potential breaches of the Covid regulations. That process has quite properly involved sharing information continuously with the Metropolitan Police, so I welcome the Met’s decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters. But I want to reassure the House, Mr Speaker, and the country, that I and the whole government are focused one hundred percent on dealing with the people’s priorities including the UK’s leading role in protecting freedom around the world. And with permission, I will make a statement about the United Kingdom’s response to the situation in Ukraine.
This winter, we have witnessed a spectacle that we hoped had been banished from our continent: a large and powerful country massing troops and tanks on the border of a neighbour, with the obvious threat of invading.
Russia has, of course, already attacked Ukraine, illegally annexing 10,000 square miles of her territory in 2014 and igniting a war in the Donbas region, and Ukraine has scarcely known a day of peace ever since. Now she faces the danger of a renewed invasion and this time the force arrayed on her frontier comprises over 100,000 troops - far bigger than anything Russia has deployed against her before. If the worst happens and the destructive firepower of the Russian army were to engulf Ukraine’s towns and cities, I shudder to contemplate the tragedy that would ensue. Ukrainians have every moral and legal right to defend their country and I believe their resistance would be dogged and tenacious, and the bloodshed comparable to the first war in Chechnya, or Bosnia, Mr Speaker, or any other conflict that Europe has endured since 1945. No-one would gain from such a catastrophe. Russia would create a wasteland in a country which as she constantly reminds us, is composed of fellow Slavs; and Russia would never be able to call it peace. For months, Britain has worked in lockstep with the United States and our allies across Europe to avoid such a disaster. We’ve sought to combine dialogue with deterrence, emphasising how a united Western alliance would exact a forbidding price for any Russian incursion into Ukraine, including by imposing heavy economic sanctions, and at the same time we stand ready, as we always have, to address any legitimate Russian concerns through honest diplomacy. On 13th December, I spoke to President Putin, and I stressed that NATO had no thought of encircling or otherwise threatening his country and that Russia enjoyed as much right as any other state to live in peace and security.
But as I said to him, Ukraine of course enjoys an equal and symmetrical right to that of Russia. And I said any attack on his neighbour would be followed by tougher sanctions against Russia, further steps to help Ukraine defend herself, and by an increased NATO presence to protect our allies on NATOs eastern flank. The truth is that if Russia’s goal is to keep NATO forces away from her borders, then if that is Russia’s goal, then invading Ukraine could scarcely be more counter-productive. My Right Honourable Friends the Foreign and Defence Secretaries have both conveyed the same message to President Putin and I am prepared of course to speak, ready to speak to him again. Meanwhile, the American Deputy Secretary of State met her Russian counterpart in Geneva on 10th January and the NATO-Russia Council gathered two days later as the House knows. The American Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, met the Russian Foreign Minister last Friday, and the US Administration has confirmed President Biden’s willingness to have another meeting with President Putin, continuing the bilateral dialogue they began last year. But credible deterrence is the other side of the coin. Last night, I held a virtual meeting with President Biden, President Macron, Chancellor Scholz, President Duda, Prime Minister Draghi, Secretary General Stoltenberg, President Michel and President von der Leyen. We agreed that we would respond in unison to any Russian attack on Ukraine, in unison, by imposing coordinated and severe sanctions, heavier than anything we have done before against Russia. 
And we agreed on the necessity of finalising these measures as swiftly as possible, in order to maximise their deterrent effect.
We in the UK will not hesitate to toughen our national sanctions against Russia in response to whatever President Putin may do – and the House will soon hear more on this from my Right Honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary. We have already declassified compelling intelligence exposing Russian intent to install a puppet regime in Ukraine and we will continue to disclose any Russian use of cyber-attacks, false flag operations or disinformation. Amid all these pressures, Ukraine asks for nothing except to be allowed to live in peace and to seek her own alliances, as every sovereign country has a right to do. Last week, the UK acted to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to defend her soil by supplying anti-armour missiles and deploying a small training team of British personnel, in addition to the work of Operation Orbital, which as the House will know, has trained 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015. Yesterday, we took the responsible precaution of temporarily withdrawing some staff and dependants from the British Embassy in Kyiv. Though I emphasise that the Embassy remains open and will continue to provide consular assistance for British nationals in Ukraine, and I am particularly grateful for the dedication of our Ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons.
I commend our NATO allies for the steps they have taken and are taking to protect the eastern flank of the alliance.
Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic and deploying four F-16s to Lithuania to join NATO’s longstanding air policing mission. France has expressed its readiness to send troops to Romania under NATO command; and the United States has raised the alert level of 8,500 combat troops, preparing to deploy them in Europe at short notice. The British Army leads the NATO Battlegroup in Estonia and if Russia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new NATO deployments to protect our allies in Europe. In every contact with Russia, the UK and our allies have stressed our unity and our adherence to vital points of principle. We cannot bargain away the vision of a Europe whole and free that emerged in those amazing years from 1989 to 1991, healing the division of our continent by the Iron Curtain. We will not reopen that divide by agreeing to overturn the European security order because Russia has placed a gun to Ukraine’s head. Nor can we accept the doctrine - implicit in Russian proposals - that all states are sovereign, but some are more sovereign than others. The draft treaty published by Russia in December would divide our continent once again between free nations and countries whose foreign and defence policies are explicitly constrained by the Kremlin, in ways that Russia would never accept for herself. More than half of Europe - including a dozen or more members of NATO and of the European Union – would be only partially sovereign and required to seek the Kremlin’s approval before inviting any military personnel from NATO countries onto their soil. The Czech Republic – at the very heart of Europe, hundreds of miles from Russia - would have to ask the Kremlin for permission if she wanted to invite a company of German infantry to join an exercise, or even to help with flood defences. There is nothing new about large and powerful nations using the threat of brute force to terrify reasonable people into giving way to otherwise completely unacceptable demands. But if President Putin were to choose the path of bloodshed and destruction, he must realise that it would be both tragic and futile, and nor should we allow him to believe that he could easily take some smaller portion of Ukraine, to salami slice, because the resistance will be ferocious. Anyone who has been to Kyiv as I have and stood by the Wall of Remembrance and studied the portraits of nearly 4,500 Ukrainians who have died in defence of their country since 2014 - and the total death toll in excess of 14,000 – anyone who’s been there will know that Ukrainians are determined to fight and have become steadily more skilled at guerrilla warfare. And if Russia pursues this path, many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home. And the response in the international community would be the same and the pain that will be inflicted on the Russian economy will be the same. When I spoke to President Putin, I also reminded him that at crucial moments in history, Britain and Russia have stood together. The only reason why both our countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council is because of the heroism of Soviet soldiers in the struggle against fascism, side-by-side with ourselves. I believe that all of Russia’s fears could yet be allayed, and we could find a path to mutual security through patient and principled diplomacy, provided that President Putin avoids the trap of starting a terrible war, and Mr Speaker, a war that I believe would earn and deserve the condemnation of history and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Welcome to the Africa Investment Conference. A wonderful moment to be able to focus on the amazing opportunities in a spectacular continent, with vast resources and over a billion people. By 2050, Africa’s population is set to double to 2.5 billion and the mother continent of humanity will be home to a quarter of the world’s population. As that day approaches, Africa is transforming its fortunes by means of trade and investment and I want Britain to be with you every step of the journey. We’re already one of Africa’s biggest commercial partners - we’ve signed nine free trade agreements with our African friends, and in this financial year alone our embassies and high commissions helped British companies to invest £2.5 billion in Africa. But I am determined to do much more. Our shared task must be to ensure that Africa prospers from the green industrial revolution, that will rescue humanity from catastrophic climate change. The UK is already the biggest investor for instance in renewable energy in South Africa. Now we want to work alongside our African partners to build new and high-quality infrastructure according to the highest standards of transparency and environmental protection, which is why we’ve launched the Clean Green Initiative. We want to support African countries that are already suffering the effects of climate change, and one export guarantee from the British Government will allow 87 emergency bridges made in Gloucestershire to be used to strengthen flood defences in Ghana. We want to be Africa’s partner of choice and if we get this right, then free trade and investment will be the most formidable tools in our hands to generate economic growth and allow Africa to thrive. Thank you.

Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on our progress against Omicron and the review of our Plan B measures. Within hours of learning from scientists in South Africa about the emergence of a new Covid variant last November, this government acted, introducing balanced and proportionate restrictions at our borders to slow the seeding of Omicron in our country. As we learned more about this highly transmissible new variant, we implemented the Plan B measures we had prepared precisely in case our situation deteriorated, encouraging people to change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus and buying crucial time to get boosters into arms. We made the big call to refocus our National Health Service, necessarily requiring the difficult postponement of many other appointments – So that we could double the speed of booster programme. And thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our NHS and its volunteers, we delivered the fastest booster programme in Europe, reaching half our population before any other European country, with more than 36 million boosters now in arms across the UK, including more than 90 per cent of all over 60s in England. And taking a balanced approach, we resisted calls from others to shut down our country all over again. Many nations across Europe have endured further winter lockdowns. Many have seen hospitality curfews and nightclubs closed, capacity limits at sports stadiums, the return of social distancing, and, in some places, Christmas and New Year as good as cancelled. But this government took a different path. We kept England open. And we supported those businesses which faced reduced demand because of the response to Plan B measures. And while we must continue to remain cautious, the data are showing that time and again this government got the toughest decisions right. Today’s latest ONS data show clearly that infection levels are falling in England. And while there are some places where cases are likely to continue rising, including in primary schools – our scientists believe it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally. There remain, of course, significant pressures on the NHS across our country, and especially in the North East and North West. But hospital admissions which were doubling every 9 days just two weeks ago – have now stabilised, with admissions in London even falling. And the numbers in intensive care not only remain low but are actually also falling. So this morning, the Cabinet concluded that because of the extraordinary booster campaign together with the way the public have responded to the Plan B measures - we can return to Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire. As a result, from the start of Thursday next week mandatory certification will end. Organisations can, of course, choose to use the NHS Covid Pass voluntarily but we will end the compulsory use of Covid status certification in England. From now, the government is no longer asking people to work from home and people should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office. And having looked at the data carefully, the Cabinet concluded that once regulations lapse, the government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere. Mr Speaker, from tomorrow, we will no longer require face masks in classrooms, and the Department for Education will shortly remove national guidance on their use in communal areas. In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded places, particularly where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet. But we will trust the judgement of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one. The government will also ease further restrictions on visits to care homes and my Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, will set out plans in the coming days. Mr Speaker, as we return to Plan A, the House will know that some measures still remain, including those on self-isolation. In particular, it is still a legal requirement for those who have tested positive for Covid to self-isolate. On Monday we reduced the isolation period to five full days with two negative tests. And there will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether - just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu. As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. The self-isolation regulations expire on 24th March, at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards. In advance of that, we will set out our long-term strategy for living with Covid-19, explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances – especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives. But to make that possible, we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. When there are still over 16,000 people in hospital in England alone, the pandemic is not over. And, Mr Speaker, make no mistake, Omicron is not a mild disease for everyone - and especially if you’re not vaccinated. Just look at the numbers in intensive care in other countries where vaccination rates are far lower. Indeed, from our NHS data, we know that around 90 per cent of people in intensive care are not boosted. So I urge members across the House to do everything possible to encourage any remaining constituents who have not done so – to get boosted now. And for the next few weeks, I encourage everyone across the country to continue with all the cautious behaviours that we know help to keep each everybody safe. washing hands, letting fresh air in, getting tested, self-isolating if positive, and, as I say, thinking about wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings. Mr Speaker, Omicron has tested us, just as Alpha and Delta did before. But let’s remember some of what we’ve achieved. We were the first nation in the world to administer a vaccine. We were the fastest in Europe to roll it out. Because outside of the European Medicines Agency, this government made the big call to pursue our own British procurement strategy rather than opting back into the EU scheme as some people urged. We created a world-beating testing programme, the largest in Europe, and procured the most antivirals of any country in Europe too, because this government made the big call to invest early in lateral flow tests and in cutting-edge drugs to protect the most vulnerable. We’ve delivered the fastest booster campaign in Europe, and we’re the first to emerge from the Omicron wave, because the government made the big call to focus on our NHS, and to refocus our activity and lead that campaign to Get Boosted Now. And that’s why we’ve retained the most open economy and society anywhere across the European continent, and the fastest growing economy in the G7 - because we made that tough decision to open up last Summer when others said that we shouldn’t, and to keep things open this winter when others wanted them shut. This week the World Health Organisation said that while the global situation remains challenging, the United Kingdom can start to see “light at the end of the tunnel”. And Mr Speaker, this is no accident of history. Confronted by the nation’s biggest challenge since the Second World War and the worst pandemic since 1918, any government would get some things wrong. but this government got the big things right. And I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a Statement on the Omicron variant, and our measures to contain this virus, fortify our NHS and keep our country open. First, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to everyone working in our NHS and social care, for their extraordinary efforts in the teeth of yet another wave of this pandemic, and for all they have done, together with thousands of volunteers, to get Britain boosted. Since we began the Get Boosted Now campaign just over three weeks ago, we have delivered 10 million extra boosters across the UK;  we have doubled the rate of vaccination from 450,000 doses a day to a peak of more than 900,000; we have matched the NHS’s previous record day, and then beaten it again and again; and we have met our target of offering a booster to every eligible adult in England a whole month early. As a result, we have a higher level of booster protection than all our European neighbours, with over 34 million boosters administered across the UK, including in England reaching more than 90 per cent of the over-70s, and 86 per cent of the over-50s. Together with the evidence that Omicron causes less severe disease than previous variants, and the way the public have conscientiously changed their behaviour in response to Plan B, this level of protection means we are in a very different position than during previous waves. I know some Hon Members might therefore ask whether this means we can now do away with measures altogether. But I am sorry to report that hospital admissions are rising rapidly, doubling around every 9 days, with already more than 15,000 Covid patients in hospital in England alone. We are experiencing the fastest growth in Covid cases that we have ever known, with over 218,000 cases reported yesterday, although that included some delayed reporting. And potentially of greatest concern, case rates are now rapidly rising among the older and more vulnerable, including doubling every week among those over 60, with the obvious risk that this will continue to increase the pressures on our NHS. So in response to the latest data, the Cabinet agreed this morning that we should stick with Plan B for another three weeks, with a further review before the regulations expire on 26 January. People in England should carry on working from home whenever they can, wear face coverings on public transport and in most indoor public places, and take a test before going to high risk venues or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. All of these measures are helping to take the edge off the Omicron wave, slow the spread of infection, manage the immediate pressures on our NHS and buy time for the boosters to take effect. And those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should, of course, continue to follow the rules where they live. Mr Speaker, faced with these pressures on our NHS, I know some Members may ask the opposite question: whether we should go even further and move towards a full lockdown. But lockdowns are not cost free. They impose a devastating toll on our physical and mental wellbeing, on our businesses, jobs and livelihoods, and, worst of all, on the life chances of our children. So this government does not believe we need to shut down our country again. Instead we are taking a balanced approach, using the protection of the boosters and the Plan B measures to reduce the spread of the virus, while acting to strengthen our NHS, protect critical national services and keep supply chains open. We’re building onsite Nightingale hospitals and creating 2,500 virtual beds to increase NHS capacity. We’ve bought more antivirals per person than anywhere else in Europe. And we’re working to identify those NHS Trusts which are most likely to need military support, so this can be prepared now. From 10th January, we will provide 100,000 critical workers in England with free lateral flow tests for every working day to help keep essential services running. This includes those who work on critical national infrastructure, national security, transport, and food distribution and processing.  And these tests are separate – and in addition – to those already allocated to our public services, such as in education, where we have delivered 31 million testing kits to schools and colleges for the start of the new term. Mr Speaker, we have the biggest testing programme in Europe, registering almost twice as many tests as France, and four times as many as Germany. Last month alone, we distributed 300 million lateral flow devices – enabling millions of people to get tested and keep their loved ones, friends and colleagues safe in the run-up to Christmas. But thanks to the sheer size of the Omicron wave, we still need to take steps to ensure our testing capacity reaches those who need it most. So we will be suspending the need to do a PCR to confirm the result of a positive lateral flow test. From next Tuesday in England, if you test positive on a lateral flow device, you should just record that result on gov.uk and begin self-isolating. Mr Speaker, our balanced approach also means that where specific measures are no longer serving their purpose, they will be dropped. So when the Omicron variant was first identified, we rightly introduced travel restrictions to slow its arrival in our country. But now Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry. So I can announce that in England from 4am on Friday we will be scrapping the pre-departure test, which discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense. We will also be lifting the requirement to self-isolate on arrival until receipt of a negative PCR, returning instead to the system we had in October last year, where those arriving in England will need to take a lateral flow test no later than the end of Day 2 and, if positive, a further PCR test to help us identify any new variants at the border. Mr Speaker, all of these measures are balanced and proportionate ways of ensuring we can live with Covid without letting our guard down. And we can only do this thanks to the biggest and fastest booster campaign in Europe. Yet Mr Speaker, there are still almost 9 million people eligible, who haven’t had their booster. As many as 90 per cent of those in intensive care with Covid have not had their booster and over 60 per cent have not had any vaccination at all. And there are 2 million slots available over the next week alone. So I urge Hon Members on all sides of the House to do everything possible to encourage your constituents to get boosted now. This is the very best way to save lives, reduce the pressure on our NHS and keep our country open. And I commend this Statement to the House.

Boris:


27th November 2021 Press Conference with British Sign Language Good afternoon. The UK’s plan against Covid has been working. We’ve had the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, and now the fastest booster campaign in Europe, with almost 16.8 million boosters in people’s arms, and though case numbers have remained relatively high, we’re seen falling hospitalisations and falling numbers of deaths. But on Wednesday we received news of a new variant - the so-called Omicron Variant - I want to express my deep gratitude to scientists in South Africa who identified this new variant and shared this information widely and immediately. This variant is spreading around the world, with 2 cases so far identified here in the UK. As always, and I must stress this, as always with a new variant, there are many things that we just cannot know at this early stage. But our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly, and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated. There is also a very extensive mutation which means it diverges quite significantly from previous configurations of the virus, and as result, it might - at least in part - reduce the protection of our vaccines over time. So we need to take targeted and proportionate measures now as a precaution while we find out more. First, we need to slow down the seeding of this variant in our country. We need to buy time for our scientists to understand exactly what we are dealing with. And for us to get more people vaccinated and - above all - to get more people boosted. As well as to help our NHS prepare in what is an already challenging winter. So yesterday we took steps to protect the UK against the variant coming here from southern African countries – and earlier today added four more countries to the red list. But we now need to go further and implement a proportionate testing regime for arrivals from across the whole world. So we are not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, we’re not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and to self-isolate until they have a negative result. Second, we need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK. Because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant, rather than stop it altogether. So in addition to the measures we are already taking to locate those who have been in countries of concern over the last ten days, we will require all contacts of those who test positive - with a suspected case of Omicron - to self-isolate for ten days, regardless of your vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this variant, by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport. And third - and most importantly - we need to bolster our protections against this new variant. We don’t yet exactly know how effective our vaccines will be against Omicron, but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. And if you are boosted – your response is likely to be stronger. So it’s more vital than ever that people get their jabs, and we get those boosters into arms as fast as possible. So from today we are going to boost the booster campaign. We are already planning to do 6 million jabs in England alone over the next three weeks. And now we are looking to go further, so the Health Secretary has asked the JCVI to consider giving boosters to as wide a group as possible, as well as reducing the gap between your second dose and your booster. And, of course, we are speaking to our counterparts in the Devolved Administrations and will continue to coordinate with them. The measures that we are taking today - including on our borders and face masks - are temporary and precautionary, and we will review them in three weeks. At that point we should have much greater information about the continuing effectiveness of our vaccines. I very much hope that we will find that we continue to be in a strong position, and we can lift these measures again. But right now this is the responsible course of action, to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new variant, and to maximise our defences so we protect the gains we have worked so hard for and so that we can continue to save lives. Thank you. 

Boris:


My Lord Mayor, My Late Lord Mayor, Your Grace, My Lord Chancellor, Your Excellencies, My Lords, Aldermen, Sheriffs, Chief Commoner, ladies and gentlemen. If I seem a little hoarse tonight, it’s nothing more epidemiologically serious than the well-known consequences of sending an 18 month old child to nursery. Fourteen days ago this country hosted the biggest gathering of world leaders since the foundation of the UN at the end of the Second World War. In fact it was far bigger: there were more than 120 heads of state and government. There has never been anything like it in our history. They came in such numbers not just because Glasgow is the place for a party, though clearly it is - glad we’ve got a good contingent of Glaswegians here tonight - not just because they wanted to be in the UK in November, famed for its good weather though it is. They came in those numbers because the scale of the crisis is unlike anything we have ever seen - an existential threat of manmade climate change that promises to destroy our environment as we know it, to rob our children and descendants of beauty and species and habitat at an unprecedented pace and to plunge humanity into a new dark ages, and I’m not joking, with warfare for basic resources such as water and vast and uncontrollable mass movements of people. They came to Glasgow because they have seen the ineluctable link between concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere and rises in temperature, and they came because they have all of them learnt the pure folly of disregarding the warnings of the scientists. And on Saturday night after years and months of work the nations of the earth came together and they forged the Glasgow Climate Pact. And of course that deal will and must have its critics and detractors from one side of the argument or the other, and we must be honest with our children, and we must confess that this deal this pact won’t do it alone. Glasgow won’t stop climate change, Glasgow won’t prevent the heating of the planet that is now baked in, but Glasgow can still help us to slow that warming down. What we have in our hands is now a road map: detailed, waymarked with milestone after milestone, and for the first time in history humanity has agreed to move beyond coal. I want to thank Alok Sharma for everything he did and for what he is going to do. Because our COP presidency didn’t end on Saturday, we are the “world COP-holders” for another year. We will build on the historic Glasgow Climate pact, which calls for countries to do better next year - accelerating the five-year cycle set out in the Paris agreement. We will push for more ambitious goals, stronger plans and better implementation, and so we further narrow that gap to 1.5 degrees. We will work from now on with partners across the world, because this is Global Britain in action. And I know how frustrating it was – as we stood on the verge of agreeing to phase out coal - to see that commitment weakened. But I tell you this: I have been watching politics a long time and human nature, and I know when a tipping point is reached. The language does matter, of course it does, whether you are talking about phasing down or phasing out, the day is now not far off when it will be as politically unacceptable, anywhere in the world, to open a new coal fired power station as it now is to get on to a plane and light a cigar. That is the social change that is afoot. We agreed to stop the terrible destruction of the forests, not just teeming with life and beauty, but the indispensable organs for fixing carbon and releasing oxygen. We signalled the global death knell for the fossil fuel driven internal combustion engine, and the developed world has started to wake up to its responsibilities, and showed that we understand the fundamental unfairness of asking the poorest and most vulnerable countries to make huge sacrifices to get to net zero, when they are by and large innocent of pumping carbon into the air. And if Glasgow has been on the whole a success, if we have made important progress, then it is worth pausing and asking ourselves why? What has changed since Madrid and Katowice and Paris and Copenhagen? And you can see how all sorts of things have come together in the minds of the leaders of the world. There is the data about what is actually happening: the storms, the floods, the fires, the swarms of locusts. There is the ever growing clamour from their electorates. Perhaps we were also helped in Glasgow by a collective sense of embarrassment at the way internationalism failed us during Covid: the squabbles about PPE, the crazy decisions of some countries, naming no names, to try to stop the export of vaccines to others, something we were victims of at the start of this year. And let me say – given all the speculation – that we would rather find a negotiated solution to the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and that still seems possible. But if we do invoke Article 16 - which by the way is a perfectly legitimate part of that Protocol – we will do so reasonably and appropriately, because we believe it is the only way left to protect the territorial integrity of our country, and meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland under the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. And I believe Glasgow worked because it was the first COP that brought the solutions with a new formula for beating climate change. And in that bee-like way of human beings we all started to swarm around the same intellectual hive. And the idea is that we can help individual countries to tackle decarbonisation, not just with taxpayers’ cash or loans, not just with the largesse of the multilateral development banks, but rather using that state funding to trigger the private sector to invest, so that we drive a green industrial revolution with millions of high wage high skill jobs at home and abroad. And perhaps the most striking example of this model a “country platform” with a specific agenda of green projects – was created through the leadership of Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, who ran the National Union of Mineworkers during the apartheid struggle, because he came up with a proposal to decarbonise his country with a just transition for the workers. This attracted a cluster of countries, including the UK, to offer a total of $8.5 bn as seed funding. And we are investing because we have seen how the model works here in the UK. Government sets the parameters, a government auction determines the strike price for – say – wind power and the private sector then has the confidence to invest in what the evidence now shows can be an immensely profitable business. And the UK will soon publish ten separate roadmaps showing exactly how we will deliver our green commitments - side-by-side with many of you here tonight -  covering electric vehicles, hydrogen and much else. Everyone has now seen the vital importance of the market and private finance and innovation and there is now a decent crop of very similar initiatives. We want to repeat this model everywhere, throughout Africa, throughout South East Asia and the Indian subcontinent, throughout Latin America. Using guarantees and all our innovative financial expertise to help create markets and get private capital flowing, and investing more as our economy recovers from Covid and we can afford to get back to 0.7% to help create a global green industrial revolution. The US has Build Back Better World, the UK has the Clean Green Initiative, the French have their One Planet initiative, the EU has its Global Gateway. It strikes me that we need to concert our activities, just as we forged new institutions after the Second World War. And I believe this concept of coalitions coalescing around science,  and security, and values,  finance and diplomacy and above all people, should be at the heart of what Global Britain is doing. Because it is clear that some countries are simply not going to evolve towards free market democracies and we should be clear eyed about that. We have to deal with it, we have to manage it, we must have relations that are as friendly and pragmatic as possible. But the consequence is that we work ever more closely with those who do share our values and instincts. So when we say that we support the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, that is not because we want to be adversarial to Russia, or that we want in some way strategically to encircle or undermine that great country. And never let it be forgotten, in this season of remembrance, that it was Russian blood that enabled us to defeat Nazism. It is because we have a commitment to democracy and freedom that is shared now across the vast mass of the European continent. And when our Polish friends asked for our help to deal with a contrived crisis on their border with Belarus, we were quick to respond. And we hope, I hope, that others may recognise, other European countries may recognise, that a choice is shortly coming, between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines, and sticking up for Ukraine  and championing the cause of peace and stability - let me put it that way. And on the same principle we do not send our Carrier Strike Group   8,000 miles to the South China seas because we are in any way hostile or adversarial to China, not at all, but because we want to show our commitment to the peace and stability of the whole Indo-Pacific region, and that’s why we exercised and operated with 36 of our friends, because freedom of the seas and open supply chains, are the lifeblood of the world economy. And that is the logic of the Indo-Pacific tilt that you will have read in the Integrated Review published earlier this year, and the Aukus arrangement. And this is not just a deal between friends: it is the beginning of cooperation on the defence and security aspects of technology of many kinds – from AI to Quantum to cyber. And that is how to express power and influence, that is how to win friends and win markets, not by encouraging others to run up unrepayable debts, not by bullying, but by creating these coalitions of the willing to fix the most urgent problems, and by staying at the forefront of technological advance. And if you have a problem around the world and you need help then let me suggest some reasons why this country, the UK, is the one to have in your coalition. It’s not just because we have record defence spending, the heavy lift capabilities that enabled us to help 36 other countries in Op Pitting from Afghanistan, the special forces, the intelligence services, and the diplomats, so well represented in this room, who by the way as Glasgow has shown us again, are pretty nifty at getting people in a room and finding the language to build a consensus. What we also have are the coders and the software engineers, the scientists and digital entrepreneurs,  oh and by the way – we have the bankers too and the lawyers – and the regulators. You want a country that can do scientific breakthroughs, come to us: there is a reason why we have more tech unicorns than anywhere else in Europe. It’s because on the whole people like to come and live and work in the UK, they like the freedom of thought and expression and the rule of law and the nightlife  and the museums, and the fact that provided they do no harm to others, on the principle of JS Mill, they can live their lives here as they please. And that is broadly why we have so many outstanding universities and so many Nobel Prizes. And we mean now to turbo-charge that, if you can turbo-charge a non-hydrocarbon engine. The other day I met Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind, which is an extraordinary company located near King’s Cross, and he told me about AI which is not a two toed sloth you use in Scrabble by the way, but artificial intelligence and he more or less blew my mind, because AI transcends the limits of our poor mammalian brains, crunches problems with astonishing speed, but also somehow creatively and intuitively, so that DeepMind has beaten all comers at Go. It is already being used to predict where the wind will blow and therefore where is the optimal place to locate your turbines and to predict any maintenance issues before they arise. And the cost of offshore wind power has already fallen by 60 per cent in the last ten years, partly thanks to AI, and you can see the potential of AI to drive it down still further. We are already using AI to rationalise energy use in the vast data storage centres that are so important to the global economy, and DeepMind has worked out how to cut the use of energy in Google data centres by 40 per cent. Imagine if we could make the same economy in the national grid. And Demis Hassabis told me how they could now use AI to predict the plasma waves inside a fusion reactor, so as to harvest the energy while controlling the extraordinary temperatures, and I know – fusion may still be a few years away: it was 20 years away 20 years ago. But when you look at what AI is already achieving, we should have the humility to accept that he might well be right and that AI could be bigger than the internet. And so the right thing for the UK to do now is to recognise this progress and support these amazing industries. We will develop our own coders and bioscientists. We will train up young people in this country, but we will also welcome the brains of the world. We will roll out the red carpet, and kill the fatted calf for the maths Olympiad victors, and the physics geniuses and anybody happens to be watching this while proving Fermat’s last theorem with one hand, and doing the washing up with the other, then get on to our Office for Global Talent and we will sort you out with a visa. And we will take advantage of our new legislative freedoms to regulate with a light touch  with minimum bossiness about the management of data. The new Advanced Research and Invention Agency will pursue the search for the things we don’t know we don’t know. And we will set particular targets and ambitions: last year we took a risk and invested in satellites called OneWeb; we now have 358 in orbit and they are on the way to providing high speed internet access to people everywhere. And we know that our national security and prosperity depend on this country’s technological prowess, and we also know that by placing our national advantage at the service of addressing common problems, we will strengthen our friendships around the world. Having talked to Demis Hassabis and to Eric Schmidt, formerly of Google, it is clear that we need to go big on Quantum Computing. If AI can mimic the intuitive flair of the human brain, then Quantum computing will enable us to process information so fast that we can process an almost infinite number of solutions at once. And if we could perfect it there are so many problems we could solve: including how to turn nitrogen into fertiliser and feed the world without creating so much C02. So I am setting the ambition that the UK will aim to build the first general purpose quantum computer, and secure fifty percent of the global quantum computing market by 2040. And that is why this country is determined to become once again a science superpower. We know that is the way to create 100,000s of jobs in the green industries of the future. Indeed it is at present levelling up across the whole country, as you rightly said my Lord Mayor. It is the way to ensure that we are not dependent on the technology of others in a way that could ultimately compromise our national security. And with our lead in the technologies of tomorrow we can help spread our values, just as we helped to distribute 1.5 bn low cost Astra Zeneca vaccines, and help to fix the problems of humanity. And that is how Global Britain can influence things for the better, not with gunboats, or not solely with gunboats, not with usurious loans, but with public billions leveraging private trillions to drive the expansion of new technological solutions, from bioscience to carbon capture and storage and the production of green hydrogen. I am finally optimistic tonight because COP has shown us that climate change may still be terrifying and complacency would be fatal, but we in the UK have the tools, we have the science, we have the finance, and the expertise, and we certainly have the global reach and we want to be your partner. Not just because it will drive jobs and growth in the UK, though it certainly will, but for the good of all humanity and all other species – including unicorns - and for the air that gives us life. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker before I begin today’s statement I would like to say a few words about the abhorrent attack that took place yesterday morning outside the Liverpool Women’s Hospital. On behalf of the whole House I want to pay tribute to the swift and professional response by the extraordinary men and women of the emergency services, who once again showed themselves to be the very best among us. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has today raised the nationwide threat level from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. The police are keeping both myself and the Home Secretary informed on developments and we will of course in turn keep the House updated on the investigation as it continues. And now Mr Speaker with your permission I should like to make a statement on the United Nations Climate Change Conference better known as COP26 which took place in the magnificent city of Glasgow over the past two weeks. It was the biggest political gathering of any kind ever held in the United Kingdom. 194 countries were represented. We had around 120 heads of state or government. 38,000 accredited delegates. And there were countless tens of thousands more in the streets and parks and venues outside. It was a summit that many people predicted would fail. A summit that I fear some quietly wanted to fail. Yet it was a summit that proved the doubters and the cynics wrong. Because COP26 did not just succeed in keeping 1.5 alive. It succeeded in doing something no UN climate conference has ever done before by uniting the world in calling time on coal. In 25 previous COPs, all the way back to Berlin in 1995, not one delivered a mandate to remove so much as a single lump of coal from one power station boiler. For decades, tackling the single biggest cause of carbon emissions proved as challenging as eating the proverbial elephant. It was just so big that no one knew quite where to start. But in Glasgow, Mr Speaker, we took the first bite. Because we have secured a global commitment to phasing down coal – and as John Kerry has pointed out, you can’t phase out coal without first phasing it down as we transition to other, cleaner energy sources – and we have, for the first time, a worldwide recognition that we’ll not get climate change under control as long as our power stations are consuming vast quantities of the sedimentary super-polluter that is coal. That alone is a great achievement, but we haven’t just signalled the beginning of the end for coal. We’ve ticked our boxes on cars, cash and trees as well. The companies that build a quarter of the world’s automobiles have agreed to stop building carbon emission vehicles by 2035 – and cities from Sao Paulo to Seattle have pledged to ban them from their streets. We’ve pioneered a whole new model, an intellectual breakthrough, that sees billions in climate finance, development bank investment and so forth being used to trigger trillions from the private sector to drive the big decarbonisation programmes in countries like South Africa. And we’ve done something that absolutely none of the commentators saw coming by building a coalition of more than 130 countries to protect up to 90 per cent of our forests, those great natural soakers of carbon. Mr Speaker none of this was a happy accident or inevitability. The fact that we were there at all, in the face of a global pandemic, is in itself the result of a vast and complex effort involving countless moving parts. Right until the very end there was a very real prospect that no agreement would be reached. And what has been achieved has only come about thanks to month after month of concerted British diplomacy, the countless meetings, the innumerable phone calls. The banging of heads at UNGA, at the Petersberg Dialogue, at President Biden’s climate summit, the Security Council, the G7, the G20. And the setting of an example, several examples by the UK. Because again and again the task of our negotiators was made easier by the fact that the UK wasn’t asking anyone to do anything we’re not doing ourselves. We’ve slashed our use of coal so much that our last two coal-fired power stations will go offline for good in 2024. We’ve more than doubled our climate finance, providing vital support for poor and vulnerable nations around the world. We’ve made a legally binding commitment to reach net zero, the first of the major economies to do so. We’ve set a date at which hydrocarbon internal combustion engines will reach the end of the road. And we’ve shown the world that it’s possible to grow your economy while cutting carbon – creating markets for clean technology and delivering new green jobs that reduce emissions and increase prosperity. Every one of those achievements was not just great news for our country and our planet but another arrow in the quiver of our fantastic team in Glasgow. A team led by COP president the Rt Hon Member for Reading West. From the moment he picked up the COP reins he has been absolutely tireless in his efforts to secure the change that we need. And while I’m pretty sure that what he really needs right now is a well-deserved break I don’t think any of us here will be able to hold him back as he sets off pushing countries to go further still and making sure the promises made in Glasgow are delivered not diluted. But success has many parents and I want to say a huge thank you to the officials in our own COP unit, in Downing Street and across government in embassies around the world, and at the United Nations who pulled out all the stops to make the event work and shepherd through the agreements that have been reached. I also want to thank everyone on the ground at the SEC in Glasgow – security, catering, transport, the relentlessly cheery volunteers, the police from across the country who kept us safe from harm, the public health authorities who kept us safe from Covid – and everyone in the Scottish Government. And above all I want to say thank you to the people of Glasgow, who had to put up with so much disruption in their city and welcomed the world all the same. I say to the people of Glasgow - we couldn’t have done it without you. Is there still more to do? Of course there is. I am not for one moment suggesting we can safely close the book on climate change. In fact I can think of nothing more dangerous than patting ourselves on the back and telling ourselves that the job is done. Because this job will not be complete until the whole world has not only set off to reach net zero but arrived at the destination. A goal that, even with the best of intentions from all actors, cannot be achieved overnight. While COP26 has filled me with optimism about our ability to get there I cannot now claim to be certain that we will, because we have seen countries that really should know better dragging their heels on their Paris commitments. But if, and it is still an if, they make good on their pledges, then I believe Glasgow will be remembered as the place where we secured an historic agreement and the world began to turn the tide. Before Paris we were on course for four degrees of warming. After Paris that number fell to a still catastrophically dangerous three. This afternoon, after Glasgow it stands close to two. Still too high, the numbers are still too hot, but closer than we have ever been to the relative safety of 1.5, and with an all-new roadmap that will lead us there. Aristotle taught us that virtue comes not from reasoning and instruction but from habit and practice. And so the success of the Glasgow Climate Pact lies not just in the promises but in the move that the whole world has now made from setting abstract targets to adopting the nuts and bolts programme of work to meet those targets and to reduce CO2 emissions. We are now talking about the how rather than the what and getting into a habit of cutting CO2 that is catching on not just with governments but with businesses and with billions of people around the world. It is for that reason that I believe COP26 has been a success and 1.5 is still alive. That is something in which every person in our United Kingdom can and should take pride, and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Six years ago the Paris Agreement made an historic commitment to end the destruction and devastation caused by climate change. Together they agreed to limit global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees with a view to keeping that increase at 1.5 degrees. But hundreds of summits, speeches, press conferences like this later, those words and promises are starting to sound, frankly, hollow. The science is clear that we need to act now to halve emissions by 2030 and keep 1.5 degrees within reach. There are no compelling excuses for our procrastination. Not only have we acknowledged the problem, we are already seeing first-hand the devastation climate change causes: from heat waves and droughts to wildfires and hurricanes. And unlike many other global challenges, the solution to climate change is clear. It lies in consigning dirty fossil fuels like coal to history, in ditching gas guzzling modes of transport and recognising the role that nature plays in preserving life on this planet, and harnessing the power of nature through renewable energy rather than orchestrating its destruction. If we don’t act right know the Paris agreement will be looked at in the future not as the moment humanity opened its eyes to the problem, but the moment we flinched and turned away. We’ve seen some progress in the last few days and weeks. Saudi Arabia, Australia and Russia have all made net zero commitments – meaning 80% of the global economy will wipe out its contribution to climate change by the middle of the century, up from 30% thanks to the UK’s COP26 leadership. Countries such as the United States have doubled their spending on climate aid. Every nation at this weekend’s summit will end the financial support for international unabated coal projects by the end of this year. But these commitments, welcome as they are, are drops in a rapidly warming ocean when we consider the challenge we have all admitted is ahead of us. Just 12 G20 members have committed to reach net zero by 2050 or earlier. Barely half of us have submitted improved plans for how we will cut carbon emissions since the Paris Summit in 2015. And we have also failed to meet our commitment to provide $100bn a year to support developing countries to grow in a clean and sustainable way. The UN says emissions will rise by 15% by 2030, and they need to halve by then. The countries most responsible for historic and present-day emissions are not yet doing their fair share of the work. If we are going to Prevent COP26 from being a failure then that must change. And I must be clear, that if Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails. The Paris Agreement will have crumpled at the first reckoning. The world’s only mechanism, viable mechanism, for dealing with climate change will be holed beneath the water line. Right now the Paris Agreement, and the hope that came with it, is just a piece of paper. We need to fill that piece of paper to populate it with real progress. And I know that humanity has in it the power to rise to the challenge. The UK has proved it can be done – we have lowered our greenhouse gas emissions by 44% in the last 30 years whilst increasing our GDP by 78%. And we’re cutting our contribution to climate change more and more every day. We have made some progress at this G20. We have had a reasonable G20, but there is a huge way still to go. We all know that we have the technology. What we need to do now is to raise the finance, but above all we need the political will, in Glasgow, to make those commitments. And to keep alive the hope of restraining the growth of our temperatures to 1.5 degrees. Thank you very much and see you in Glasgow. 

Boris:


Thank you, thank you very much Mr President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentleman. Great speech Mario and ciao from Londra. I’m very sorry I’m not able to be with you today, but I just want to say to all of you at this gathering: Mario, you and I, we’ve got to face it. We were born in the 1960s; the politicians, I’m afraid, like us -  we’re middle aged people. And we’re going to be meeting to thrash out the world’s path to net zero in just a few weeks’ time at COP26. But it will be the people in the audience, it will be your generation, young people, who are left to deal with the consequences if we should fail. Because a child born in 2020 will endure seven times as many extreme heatwaves and twice as many droughts as their grandparents. And as this gathering has heard in sometimes harrowing detail, young people around the world are already paying the price for the reckless actions of their elders. Hundreds of millions of you are facing rising seas, failing crops, burning forests and ever-more ferocious storms. Daily challenges that lead to lost opportunity. Your future is being stolen before your eyes, and I saw the protestors earlier on, and frankly you have every right to be angry with those who aren’t doing enough to stop it. And perhaps the most frustrating thing is that we know we can stop it. There is still just enough time to put on the brakes. We know what needs to be done, we just have to get on with it. It’s a big task, one that will ask a lot of absolutely everybody. But change on the scale we need is perfectly possible. When I was a child something like 80 per cent of the UK’s electricity was generated by burning coal. Even as recently as 2010 we got 10 times more electricity from fossil fuels than from renewables. Yet today, as I speak to you, most of the electricity consumed in the UK comes from clean green sources. Our carbon emissions are barely half what they were in 1990. And coal, which was once the undisputed king of our energy mix, now accounts for less than two per cent of our electricity – a number that will hit zero within the next couple of years. I tell you this not because I want to brag about how great the UK is – because I’m the first to admit that we all have much more to do – but because I want to show what can be achieved when people and politicians have the will to make change happen. That’s why it’s so important that these three days are not the end of the story. We’ve got 190 countries represented here, almost 190 countries represented here. And if between now and November, the COP26 Summit, that you all continue to raise your voices in the way that you have, as passionately and articulately as you are doing; and if you can keep talking to the politicians and the business leaders where you live about this issue and why you care about it and why we must have action - then what I’m saying to you is we can turn this thing around. And the four things we want to come out of COP26, four big changes in our approach, and it’s very easy to remember – it’s coal, cars, cash and trees; coal cars, cash and trees. We want to move away, as I’ve described, from using coal as the way we generate electricity, we want to move to move towards renewables. We want all the countries in the world to move off coal. We want everybody to stop using internal combustion engine vehicles, and it can be done, people are moving away from them as we speak. As Mario has just said in his really excellent speech, we want to raise the funds that the whole world needs, the developing world in particular, to tackle climate change - and we need to get up to $100 billion. And we need to plant 100s of millions if not trillions of trees around the world. If we do all that, we can make COP26 in November, which Mario and I are working on, we can make it the beginning of the end of climate change. So without being unduly rhapsodical, when you’re my age, you young folks, you young thrusters out there, you’ll inhabit not a world on fire, but a planet where your phones and your computers and your lights are powered by the wind and the water, the waves and the sun; You’ll inhabit a world where electric cars glide silently down your streets from California to Cape Town;  emission-free, guilt-free jet zero planes will fly overhead; and all of us will be able to deal with whatever the climate throws at us. So what I’m saying to you is that the situation is dire, it is frightening, but change is possible and it can be done. So help me and help us to make it happen at COP26. And together let’s make this earth the planet that you deserve. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


PM statement to the House of Commons on health and social care: 7 September 2021 Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement on the government’s plans for health and social care. Our National Health Service is the pride of our whole United Kingdom and all the more so, after it has been there for us during the worst pandemic in a century, treating almost half a million patients, administering more than 88 million vaccines and saving countless lives. But the inevitable consequence of this necessary - and extraordinary – action is that Covid has placed massive pressures on our NHS. As we stayed at home to protect the NHS, thousands of people did not come forward for the treatment they needed. Like those who suffer from Covid, these are all people we know. Your aunt who needs a new hip. Your neighbour who has problems with their heart and needs a pacemaker. Your friends your friends at work who thinks they should get that lump or cough checked out. So we must now help the NHS to recover, to be able to provide this much needed care to our constituents and the people we love – and we must provide the funding to do so now. We not only have to pay for the operations and treatments that people decided not to have during the pandemic, we need to pay good wages for the 50,000 nurses who will enable that treatment, and who can help us tackle waiting lists that could otherwise expand to 13 million over the next few years. We need to now to go beyond the record funding we have already provided – and we need to go further than the 48 hospitals and 50 million more GP appointments that are already in our plan. So today we are beginning the biggest catch-up programme in NHS history, tackling the Covid backlogs by increasing hospital capacity to 110 per cent, and enabling nine million more appointments, scans and operations. As a result, while waiting lists will get worse before they get better, the NHS will aim to be treating around 30 per cent more elective patients by 2024/25 than before Covid. And we will also fix the long-term problems of health and social care of health and social care have been so cruelly have been so cruelly exposed by Covid. But having spent more than £407 billion or more to support lives and livelihoods throughout the pandemic - from furlough to vaccines - it would be wrong for me to say that we can pay for this recovery without taking the difficult but responsible decisions about how we finance it. As a permanent additional investment in health and social care – it would be irresponsible to meet the costs from higher borrowing and higher debt. From next April we will create a new, UK-wide, 1.25 per cent Health and Social Care Levy on earned income, hypothecated in law to health and social care, with dividends rates increasing by the same amount. This will raise almost £36 billion over the next three years, with money from the levy going directly to health and social care across the whole of our United Kingdom. This won’t be pay awards for middle management, it will go straight to the front line at a time when we need to get more out of our health and social care system than ever before. And it will enable radical innovation to improve the speed and quality of care, including better screening equipment to diagnose serious diseases, such as cancer, more quickly, designated surgical facilities so non-urgent patients are no longer competing with A&amp;E, faster GP access to specialists, so you don’t have to wait months to see someone in hospital to find out whether something is wrong, and new digital technology so doctors can monitor patients remotely in their homes. And we will do all this in a way that is right, and reasonable and fair. Mr Speaker, some will ask why we don’t increase income tax or capital gains instead. But income tax isn’t paid by businesses, so the whole burden would fall on individuals, roughly doubling the amount that the basic rate taxpayer could expect to pay. And the total revenue from capital gains tax amounts to less than £9 billion this year. Instead our new levy will share the cost between individuals and businesses, and everyone will contribute according to their means, including those above State Pension Age, so those who earn more those who earn more will pay more. And because we are also increasing dividends tax rates we will be asking better-off business owners and investors to make a fair contribution too. In fact, the highest earning 14 per cent will pay around half the revenues, no-one earning less than £9,568 will pay a penny, and the majority of small businesses will be protected, with 40 per cent of all businesses paying nothing at all. And while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own systems, we will direct money raised through the levy to their health and social care services. So in total Scotland - yes - in total Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will benefit from an extra £2.2 billion a year Mr Speaker - and as this is about 15 per cent more than they will contribute through the levy, it will create a union dividend worth £300 million. Worth £300 million. But Mr Speaker, we cannot just put more money in. We need reform and change. We need to build back better from Covid. When the Covid storm broke last year there were 30,000 hospital beds in England occupied by people who could have been better cared for elsewhere – and who wanted to be better cared elsewhere. That is 30,000 Mr Speaker out of 100,000 hospital beds in our NHS, costing billions every night, and unable to be used by people needing cancer care needing hip operations, making it harder than ever to deal with the growing backlog in our NHS. Too often people were in hospital beds because they or their relatives were worried about the cost of care in a residential home. And that same fear kept many others at home without any care at all. This anxiety affects millions of people up and down the country, the fear that a condition like dementia, one of nature’s bolts from the blue could lead to the total liquidation of their assets, their lifetime savings, their home - the loss of everything that they might otherwise pass on to their children, however great or small - while sufferers from other diseases – who have had to be in hospital for the majority of their treatment – have their care paid for in full by the NHS. Governments have ducked this problem for decades. Parliament parliament even voted to fix it, and yet that 30,000 figure is an indictment of the failure to do so. And so Mr Speaker there can be no more dither and delay. We know we can’t rely solely we know we can’t rely solely on private insurance because demand would be too low for insurers to offer an affordable price. And a universal system of free care for all would be needlessly expensive, when those who can afford to contribute to their care should do so. Instead the state should target its help at protecting people against the catastrophic fear of losing everything to pay for the cost of their care, and that is what this government will do. We are setting a limit on what people can be asked to pay, and we will be working with the financial services industry to innovate and help people to insure themselves against expenditure up to that limit. Wherever you live, whatever your age, your income or your condition, from October 2023 no-one starting care will pay more than £86,000 over their lifetime, and no-one with assets of less than £20,000 no-one with assets of less than £20,000 will have to make any contribution from their savings or housing wealth – up from £14,000 today. Meanwhile anyone with assets between £20,000 and £100,000 will be eligible for some means-tested support. And this new upper capital limit of £100,000 is more than four times the current limit, helping many more people with modest assets. And as we fix this long-term long-standing problem in social care, we will also address the fears that many have about how their loved ones will be looked after, by investing in the quality of care, in carers themselves, and by integrating health and care in England so older people and disabled people are cared for better, with dignity, and in the right setting. And my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care will be bringing forward a White Paper on integration later this year. Mr Speaker, you can’t fix you can’t fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs; you can’t fix the NHS without fixing social care; you can’t fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care; and you can’t fix health and social care without long-term reform. The plan that this Government is setting out today, the plan I am setting out today will fix all of those problems together. And, of course, and, of course, no Conservative government no Conservative government mr speaker ever wants to raise taxes, and I will be honest with the House, I accept yes I accept this breaks a manifesto commitment, which is not something I do lightly. But a global pandemic was in no-one’s manifesto Mr Speaker. I think the people in this country understand that in their bones and they can see the enormous debts this Government the Treasury has taken. After all the extraordinary actions that have been taken to protect lives and livelihoods over the last eighteen months, this is the right, the reasonable and fair approach, enabling our amazing NHS to come back strongly from the crisis, tackling the Covid backlogs, funding our nurses, making sure people get the care and treatment they need, in the right place at the right time, and ending a chronic and unfair anxiety for millions of people and their families up and down this country. And I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will update the House on the situation in Afghanistan, and our enduring effort to provide sanctuary for those to whom we owe so much. Since the House last met, our armed forces, diplomats and civil servants have completed the biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history, overcoming every possible challenge, in the most harrowing conditions -and bringing 15,000 people to safety in the UK and helping 36 other countries airlift their own nationals. They faced the pressure of a remorseless deadline, and witnessed a contemptible terrorist attack at the very gates of the airport, with two British nationals and thirteen of our American allies among the dead. But they kept going and in the space of a fortnight they evacuated our own nationals alongside Afghan friends of this country who guided, translated and served with our soldiers and officials, proving their courage and loyalty beyond doubt - sometimes in the heat of battle. The whole House will join me in commending the courage and ingenuity of everyone involved in the Kabul Airlift, one of the most spectacular operations in our country’s post-war military history. This feat exemplified the spirit of all 150,000 British service men and women who deployed in Afghanistan over the last two decades, of whom 457 laid down their lives and many others suffered trauma and injury. Thanks to their efforts, no terrorist attack against this country or any of our Western allies has been launched from Afghanistan for twenty years. They fulfilled the first duty of the British armed forces - to keep our people safe - and they and their families should take pride in everything they did. Just as they kept us safe, so we shall do right by our veterans. In addition to the extra £3 million we have invested in mental health support through NHS Op Courage, we are providing another £5 million to assist the military charities who do such magnificent work, with the aim of ensuring that no veteran’s request for help will go unanswered. And now the evacuation – Op Pitting – will give way to Operation Warm Welcome,  with an equal effort to help our Afghan friends begin their new lives here in the United Kingdom, and recognising the strength of feeling across the House about the plight of individual Afghans. Years before this episode, we began to fulfil our obligation to those Afghans who had helped us, bringing 1,400 to the UK. Then, in April this year, we expanded our efforts by opening the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy,   and even before the onset of Operation Pitting we had brought around 2,000 to the UK between June and August.
And our obligation lives on. So let me say to anyone to whom we have made commitments - and who is currently in Afghanistan – we are working urgently with our friends in the region to secure safe passage and as soon as routes are available we will do everything possible to help you to reach safety. Over and above this effort, the UK is formally launching a separate resettlement programme, providing a safe and legal route for up to 20,000 Afghans in the region over the coming years, with 5,000 in the first year. We are upholding Britain’s finest tradition of welcoming those in need and I emphasise that under this scheme we will of course work with the UN and aid agencies to identify those we should help, as we have done in respect of those who fled the war in Syria – but we will also include Afghans who have contributed to civil society or who face a particular risk from the Taliban, for example, because of their role in standing up for democracy and human rights, or because of their gender, or sexuality or religion. All who come to our country through this safe and legal route will receive not a five year visa, but indefinite leave to remain and our support will include free English courses for adults, and 300 university scholarships. We will shortly be writing to local authorities and the Devolved Administrations with details on funding for extra school places and long-term accommodation across the UK. I am grateful for everything they are doing, and, of course, for the work of my Honourable Friend the Minister for Afghan resettlement. I am delighted – but not surprised – that across our country, people have been fundraising for our Afghan friends and we have received numerous offers of help from charities and ordinary families alike, and anyone who wishes to join that effort can do so through gov.uk. Mr Speaker, our first duty is the security of the United Kingdom and if the new regime in Kabul wants international recognition and access to the billions of dollars currently frozen in overseas accounts, then we and our friends will hold them to their agreement to prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming an incubator for terrorism. And we shall insist on safe passage for anyone who wishes to leave, and respect for the rights of women and girls.
Our aim is to rally the strongest international consensus behind these principles, so that as far as possible the world speaks to the Taliban with one voice. To that end, I called an emergency meeting of G7 leaders which made these aims the basis of our common approach, and the UK helped to secure a UN Resolution, passed by the Security Council last week, making the same demands. Later this month, at the UN General Assembly in New York, I will work with Secretary-General Guterres and other leaders to widen that consensus still further. We will judge the Taliban by their actions not their words and use every economic, political and diplomatic lever to protect our own countries from harm and to help the Afghan people. We have already doubled the UK’s humanitarian and development assistance to £286 million this year, including to help people in the region. Mr Speaker, on Saturday we shall mark the 20th anniversary of the reason why we went into Afghanistan in the first place: the terrorist attacks on the United States which claimed 2,977 lives, including those of 67 Britons. And if anyone is still tempted to say that we have achieved nothing in that country in twenty years, tell them that our armed forces and those of our allies enabled 3.6 million girls to go to school; tell them that this country and the Western world were protected from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan throughout that period; and tell them we have just mounted the biggest humanitarian airlift in recent history: eight times, the RAF rescued more than 400 people on board a single plane – the most that have ever travelled on an RAF aircraft in its 103 year history, helping thousands of people in fear for their lives, helping thousands to whom this country owes so much, and thereby revealing the fundamental values of the United Kingdom. There are very few countries that have the military capability to do what we have just done and fewer still who would have felt the moral imperative to act in the same way. We can be proud of our forces for everything they have achieved and for the legacy they leave behind. And what they did was in the best traditions of this country, and I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move – and may I begin by thanking you and all the Parliamentary staff for enabling us to meet this morning. Before I turn to today’s debate, I am sure the House will want to join you and me in sending our condolences to the family and friends of those killed in the appalling shooting in Plymouth last week. Investigations are, of course, continuing but we will learn every possible lesson from this tragedy. Mr Speaker, I know that Members across the House share my concern about the situation in Afghanistan, issues it raises for our own security, and the fears of many remaining in that country – especially women and children. The sacrifice in Afghanistan is seared into our national consciousness, with 150,000 people serving there from across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom, including a number of Members on all sides of the House, whose voices will be particularly important today. And so it is absolutely right that we should come together for this debate. I thank my honourable friend and I can assure him that I will be saying in just a few moments, we will be doing everything we can to support those who have helped the UK mission in Afghanistan and investing everything we can to support the wider area around Afghanistan and to do everything we can to avert a humanitarian crisis. Mr Speaker, it is almost twenty years since the United States suffered the most catastrophic attack on its people since the Second World War, in which 67 British citizens also lost their lives at the hands of murderous terrorist groups incubated in Afghanistan. In response, NATO invoked Article V of its Treaty, for the first and only time in its history, and the United Kingdom, amongst others, joined America in going into Afghanistan on a mission to extirpate Al Qaeda in that country and to do whatever we could to stabilise Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew that we would face. And we succeeded in that core mission. As I said in the House just a few weeks ago, there was an extensive defence review about the Afghan mission after the combat mission ended in 2014, and I believe most of the key questions have already been extensively gone into. It’s important Mr Speaker that we in this House should be able to scrutinise events as they unfold. Mr Speaker, we succeeded in that core mission and the training camps in the mountain ranges of Afghanistan were destroyed, Al Qaeda plots against this country were foiled because our serving men and women were there, and no successful terrorist attacks against the West have been mounted from Afghan soil for two decades. Mr Speaker, I think it would be fair to say that the events in Afghanistan have unfolded and the collapse has been faster than I think even the Taliban themselves predicted. What is not true is to say that the UK Government was unprepared or did not forsee this, because it was certainly part of our planning, of pitting the very difficult logistical operation for the withdrawal of UK nationals has been under preparation for many months Mr Speaker,  and I can tell the house that the decision to commission the emergency handling centre at the airport took place two weeks ago, Mr Speaker Alongside this core mission, we worked for a better future for the people of Afghanistan. And the heroism and tireless work of our armed forces contributed to national elections, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and equalities in a way that many in Afghanistan had not previously known. Whereas twenty years ago almost no girls went to school and women were banned from positions of governance, now 3.6 million girls have been in school this year alone, and women hold over a quarter of the seats in Afghanistan’s parliament. But Mr Speaker, we must be honest and accept that huge difficulties were encountered at each turn and some of this progress is fragile. The honourable gentleman raises exactly the right question. I spoke this morning to Ambassador Sir Laurie Bristow as well as to Brigadier Dan Blanchford who is handling the evacuation And it would be fair to say the situation has stabilised since the weekend but it remains precarious and the UK officials on the ground are doing everything that they can to expedite the movement of people, those that need to come out, whether from ARUP scheme or eligible persons to get from Kabul to the airport. And at the moment it would be fair to say the Taliban are allowing that evacuation to go ahead. But the most important thing is that we get this done in as expeditious a fashion as we can, and that’s what we are doing. And I may say that I am grateful not just to the UK forces who are now out there helping to stabilise the airport but also to the US forces as well The combat phase of our mission ended in 2014 when we brought the vast majority of our troops home and handed over responsibility for security to the Afghans themselves, and we continued to support their efforts Even at that stage, we should remember that conflict was continuous, and that in spite of the bravery and sacrifice of the Afghan army – and we should never forget that 69,000 of those Afghan army troops have given their lives in this conflict – significant parts of the country remained contested or under Taliban control. And so when after two decades, the Americans prepared to take their long-predicted and well-trailed step of a final extraction of their forces, we looked at many options, Mr Speaker, including the potential for staying longer ourselves, finding new partners, or even increasing our presence, I think that when he asked for a commentary on the respective military potential power of the Taliban and the Afghan forces, it’s pretty clear from what has happened that the collapse of the Afghan forces has been much faster than expected And as for our NATO allies and our allies around the world, when it came for us to look at the options that this country might have in view of the American decision to withdraw, we came up against this hard reality that since 2009, America has deployed 98 per cent of all weapons released from NATO aircraft in Afghanistan, and at the peak of the operation, when there were 132,000 troops on the ground, 90,000 of them were American. The West could not continue this US-led mission, a mission conceived and executed in support and defence of America, without American logistics, without US air power and without American might. I spoke to Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO only the other day about NATO’s continuing role in Afghanistan. But I really think it is an illusion to believe that there is appetite amongst any of our partners for a continued military presence or for a military solution imposed by NATO in Afghanistan. The idea ended with the combat mission in 2014 and I do not believe that today deploying tens of thousands of British troops to fight the Taliban is an option, no matter how sincerely people may advocate it, and I appreciate their sincerity, but I do not believe that is an option that would commend itself either to the British people or to this House. Mr Speaker, we must deal with the position as it now is, accepting what we have achieved and what we have not achieved. The government has been working around the clock to deal with the unfolding situation. We must deal with the world as it is, accepting what we have achieved and what we have not achieved. The UK will work with our international partners on a shared plan to support the people of Afghanistan and to contribute to regional stability. There will be five parts, Mr Speaker, to this approach. First, our immediate focus must be on helping those to whom we have direct obligations, by evacuating UK nationals, together with those Afghans who have assisted our efforts over the past twenty years. And I know the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the bravery and commitment of our Ambassador, Sir Laurie Bristow, I thank the right honourable gentleman for raising the very needy case that he does. I am sure that colleagues across the House, literally every member will I imagine have received messages from people who know someone who needs to get out of Afghanistan, And I can tell the right honourable gentleman that we are doing everything we can to help out of that country those people to whom we owe a debt of obligation And on that point, I want to repeat my thanks, not just to Sir Laurie Bristow, but also our commander on the ground, Brigadier Dan Blanchford and the entire British team in Kabul. I can tell the House that we have so far secured the safe return of 306 UK nationals and 2,052 Afghan nationals as part of our resettlement programme, with a further 2,000 Afghan applications completed and many more being processed. UK officials are working round the clock to keep the exit door open in the most difficult circumstances, and actively seeking those we believe are eligible but as yet unregistered. That’s why it’s been so important that we maintain a presence at Kabul airport and that’s why we’ve been getting the message out that we want people to come through As I said earlier on, it is important for everybody to understand that at the moment in the days that we have ahead of us, which may be short, but at the moment, this is an environment in which the Taliban are permitting the evacuation to take place. Mr Speaker, these are interpreters, they are locally engaged staff and others who have risked their lives supporting our military efforts and seeking to secure new freedoms for their country. We are proud to bring these brave Afghans to our shores – and we continue to appeal for more to come forwards. Mr Speaker, that’s the 5000 on whom we are spending £200 million to bring a further 5000 on top – I think it will be 10,000 altogether that we bring under the ARUP and other programmes. We will be increasing that number over the coming years as I said to 20,000. But the bulk of the effort of this country will be directed, and should be directed, to supporting people in Afghanistan and in the region in order to prevent a worse humanitarian crisis I tell the House that in that conviction I am supported very strongly both by President Macron of France and by Chancellor Merkel of Germany. We are also doing everything possible to accelerate the visas – we are making sure that we bring back the 35 brilliant Chevening scholars, so that they can come and study in our great universities. We are deploying an additional 800 British troops to support this evacuation operation, and I can assure the House that we will continue this operation for as long as conditions at the airport allow. We will not be sending people back to Afghanistan and nor by the way will we be allowing people to come from Afghanistan to this country in an indiscriminate way. We want to be generous but we must make sure we look after our own security. Over the coming weeks, we will redouble our efforts, working with others to protect the British homeland and all our citizens and interests, from any threats that may emanate from a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, from terrorism to the narcotics trade. Like many of us I have been extensively lobbied on behalf of the excellent work done by Mr Pen Farthing – I am well aware of his cause and all the wonderful things he has done. And for animals in Afghanistan I can tell my honourable friend that we will do everything we can to help Mr Pen Farthing and others who face particular difficulty like himself But as I say without in any way jeopardising our own national security These are concerns shared across the international community, from the region itself to all the NATO alliance and indeed all five permanent members of the UN Security Council. and I will chair a virtual meeting of the G7 in the coming days. Third, Mr Speaker, we also have an enduring commitment to all the Afghan people, and now, more than ever, we must reaffirm that commitment. Our efforts must be focused on supporting the Afghan people in the region itself, particularly those fleeing conflict or the threat of violence. We therefore call on the United Nations to lead a new humanitarian effort in this region. I’m very grateful to right honourable lady opposite because I think she’s asked a question that formed in many people’s minds about the 5000 And yes indeed the 5000 extra and the resettlement scheme and in addition to those already announced – we will support those people in coming to this country We will also support the wider international community in delivering on humanitarian projects in the region by doubling the amount of humanitarian and development assistance that we had previously committed to Afghanistan this year, with new funding, taking this up to £286 million with immediate effect. And we call on others to work together on a shared humanitarian effort, focusing on helping the most vulnerable in what will be formidably difficult circumstances. My Right Honourable friend makes an excellent point and that’s why the UK has chaired the security council of the UN, and asked to put the motion together with our French friends to get the world to focus on the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan And we’ll be doing the same thing in NATO, in the G7 and the other bodies in which we have a leadership role. We want all these countries to step up as he rightly says and focus on the most vulnerable in what we will be formidably difficult circumstances Fourth, while we must focus on the region itself, we will also create safe and legal routes for those Afghans most in need to come and settle here in the UK. So in addition to those Afghans with whom we have worked directly, I can announce today that we are committing to relocating another 5,000 Afghans this year, with a new and bespoke resettlement scheme focusing on the most vulnerable, particularly women and children, and we will keep this under review for future years, with the potential of accommodating up to 20,000 over the long-term. And so taken together Mr Speaker, we are committing almost half a billion pounds of humanitarian funding to support the Afghan people. Fifth, Mr Speaker, we must also face the reality of a change of regime in Afghanistan, and as President of the G7, the UK will work to unite the international community behind a clear plan for dealing with this regime in a unified and concerted way. Over the last three days I have spoken with the NATO and UN Secretaries General, with President Biden, Chancellor Merkel, President Macron, and Prime Minister Khan, We are clear and we have agreed that it would be a mistake for any country to recognise any new regime in Kabul prematurely or bilaterally. Instead, those countries that care about Afghanistan’s future should work towards common conditions about the conduct of the new regime before deciding, together, whether to recognise it and on what terms. We will judge this regime based on the choices it makes – and by its actions rather than by its words. On its attitude to terrorism, to crime and narcotics, as well as humanitarian access and the rights of girls to receive an education. Defending human rights will remain of the highest priority. And we will use every available political and diplomatic means to ensure that those human rights remain at the top of the international agenda. Mr Speaker, our United Kingdom has a rollcall of honour that bears the names of 457 service men and women who gave their lives in some of the world’s harshest terrain, and many others who bear injuries to this day fighting in what had become the epicentre of global terrorism, and even amid the heart-wrenching scenes we see today, I believe they should be proud of their achievements, and we should be deeply proud of them, because they conferred benefits that are lasting and ineradicable on millions of people in one of the poorest countries on earth, and they provided vital protection for two decades to this country and the rest of the world. They gave their all for our safety, and we owe it to them to give our all to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a breeding ground for terrorism. Because no matter how grim the lessons of the past, that future is not yet written, and at this bleak turning-point, we must help the people of Afghanistan to choose the best of all their possible futures, and in the UN, the G7, in NATO, with friends and partners around the world that is the critical task on which this government is now urgently engaged, and will be engaged in the days to come. 

Boris:


This is an extraordinary moment in your lives and your careers you have just completed one of the most famous and intensive courses of military training since the Spartans threw their recruits into rivers and I can imagine that in the last 44 weeks there have been times when some of you may have wondered fleetingly whether it has really been worth it when you’re yo-yoing 50 feet above the tarmac on a two rope bridge with nothing to break your fall when you’re tiger crawling through malodorous slurry like the final scene of the shawshank redemption when you are getting the hairdryer treatment from the RSM because he has detected a blemish in the sheen of your toecaps and he is casting doubt in front of the whole parade ground on your paternity and on the morals of your mother and I apologise to all loving parents here, but we must be frank about the kind of thing that is said on these parade grounds then you can be forgiven if for a tiny second you have said to yourself quietly stuff this for a lark and we know how exacting this course can be we know that Winston Churchill himself failed three times even to be selected for Sandhurst we know that on average one in six of your friends, fellow cadets, has dropped out and I am here on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the whole country to thank you for persevering because it is in those very moments of adversity and self doubt that resilience is forged You have learned something far more important than how to use kiwi and cotton wool and water to shine your toecaps or how to fire a gun because the face of battle has changed utterly since Sandhurst officers formed their men into scarlet squares at the battle of Waterloo and the weapons of war, you can see around you have changed beyond recognition even since I was a cadet I was trained on a Lee Enfield 303 that had been used at the battle of Mons and I will never forget the terror on the face of my instructor but there is one utensil that has not changed, one priceless skill that Sandhurst gives you and that is leadership the ability to inspire, to improvise, to rally, to think ahead constantly to put yourself in the shoes of others and to help bring out the best in them, not to make them believe that you can do anything, but that they can do anything and after 220 years in which British Armed Forces have found themselves engaged for good or ill in about 163 of the 193 countries in the UN and in which we have acquired and unbundled an empire seven times bigger than the Roman empire at its height we in this country are wise enough and humble enough to understand that the aim of our amazing armed forces should never again be conquest and the purpose of all our military professionalism should never be war, but peace and friendship and so it is fantastic that today there are soldiers from 22 other countries from Sierra Leone to the US and I wish you the very best in your careers and if you cannot all follow the example of one distinguished middle eastern leader who I am told has constructed an entire replica of a Camberley pub complete with bar staff I hope that you will look back fondly on your time here and in particular to the weather and to those of you who will be helping to lead the British army thank you for what you are going to do to uphold the values of this country freedom, democracy human rights the rule of law, bravery, perseverance in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world and in this country too when there are flood defences to be dug, when there are hospitals to be built and patients to be airlifted from remote Hebridean islands when there are vaccine centres to be constructed with lightning speed and thousands upon thousands of lives to be saved here in the UK we know that we can rely on the men and women of the British army and the leadership that has been acquired here at Sandhurst Thank you for sticking with it I am proud of you, your families are proud of you and I know that you are going to make the whole country proud of you Thank you very much and congratulations 

Boris:


Well, good evening, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you and congratulations to you all. Great to see you in person, by the way, isn’t it wonderful that the vaccines have liberated us to be able to come to this conference in London, a wonderful thing. Great to see you all, despite your masks, I see some familiar friends in spite of the masks, some of you have taken your masks off in a daring way,  but that’s absolutely fine - you’re socially distanced. Now listen everybody I want to thank you all for raising your hands, raising your hands high and then thrusting them deep into your pockets in the way that you are, producing this staggering sum of $4 billion going on $5 billion. We often go to summits, we did before COVID struck, and we’d see very often a lot of men in suits, let’s be clear men in suits basically saying that there was a problem before humanity that was so big and so intractable that there was no silver bullet, no quick fix, no simplistic solution.  Have you ever been in a meeting like that? Well, this is not that meeting. I want to say this GPE, this Global Partnership for Education, is completely different because this is the silver bullet, this is the magic potion, this is the panacea. This is the universal cure, this is the Swiss Army knife, complete with allen key and screwdriver and everything else that can solve virtually every problem that afflicts humanity. And I’m absolutely serious, if you educate the world properly and fairly then of course you end a great natural injustice. But also, if you end the injustice that nine out of ten 10 year olds cannot read a story around the country, 132 million kids aren’t in school or in many of the countries represented here, alas, there are too few girls in school, and there is a gross disparity, a gross disparity in the education of boys and girls.  If you end that injustice and you give every girl in the world the same education as every boy, 12 years of quality education, then you perform the most fantastic benefits for humanity- you lift life expectancy, you lift per capita GDP, you deal with infant mortality, and if you educate proper people properly in the way that they deserve then of course you end or you help to end all kinds of ignorance and prejudice and by educating people you help to end all the things that ignorance and prejudice help to create so you deal with terrorism and with war and extremism, and you help people to tackle climate change. And so I’m immensely proud of the achievements of this GPE Summit today, I’m proud of what the UK has been able to contribute in spite of the difficult financial circumstances that we’re all going through. We have lashed out 430 million pounds, as Julia rightly pointed out, the biggest sum we’ve ever contributed and I’m proud of the work we do around the world helping to educate young people across our planet, giving lessons in Hauser on the radio in Nigeria, I think it’s amazing to see what we do in South Asia teaching young girls in schools. Now I know, as Uhuru has said, that this pandemic has made things more difficult and we’ve lost ground and we all know the risk that inequality will now be entrenched but now is the time to make up that ground. Necessity has been the mother of invention, we’ve all learned how to cope with Zoom, some of us better than others. I think the younger generation probably are getting the hang of this electronic technology perhaps even better than some of us here in this room and they understand how to impart and imbibe information through the internet and I think we’ve got to make sure that we support through our GP, we support Edtech, we support the technical progress that we can make through laptops, through devices of all kinds, we should support the creation of infrastructure of classrooms, of course that’s the right thing to do. But never forget fundamentally what this is all about, what is education? Education is the imparting of knowledge of instruction by one human being to another. The people we really need to thank and the people we really need to think about are the teachers across the world. Everybody in this room will probably have somebody that you can think of that was the teacher who made the difference to your life, who encouraged you, who gave you confidence, can you think of one Julia? Mr Crow, there you go, well Julia would not be here without Mr Crow, let’s hear it for Mr crow. Uhuru, I seem to remember that lesson, do you remember that lesson we did with your kids. I owe a lot to all my teachers but I think in particular have a guy called Mr Fox, when I was about, I think about 10 years old, and he took me into the library and I don’t know whether he thought I was in need of remedial help, or whether he thought I had potential, it was never clear to me but he said to me I want you to read these books and it made a fantastic difference and a lasting difference to my life. I just want to say the best thing about this summit here today is that we are supporting with huge injections of cash those amazing people across the world who are inspiring young people to think that they can succeed. And they can succeed. And by the way let me give you one idea, someone somewhere, some child somewhere who is being supported by the over 4bn dollars, [what is it? there’s some doubt about this, oh it’s over 4bn dollars but going to be 5bn over 5 years] but some child somewhere may well be the one who goes on to develop the next vaccine to deal with cancer or whatever other problem afflicts humanity. Some kid around the world will absolutely no doubt have their lives transformed, many many kids will have their lives transformed by these funds and that is the objective- to unleash potential across the planet. It’s a fantastic thing that you’ve done, I’m very very proud the UK has been able to be part of it and with Uhuru with Julia to offer leadership. Thank you for coming to London, thank you for supporting the GPE, thank you for digging into your pockets and thank you for investing in education and young people across our planet, it is the single best investment we can make in the future of humanity. Thank you all. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, today we’ve reached the fourth step on our roadmap and I know that with cases increasing steadily and with more and more people being asked to self-isolate, there will, of course, be those who would rather that we waited weeks or months longer and kept social distancing and all the restrictions that we have been placing on our lives. And so I want to remind you all why I believe that taking this step now - however difficult it seems - and the logic remains the same that if we don’t open up now then we face a risk of even tougher conditions in the colder months when the virus has a natural advantage and we lose that firebreak of the school holiday. And there comes a point when restrictions no longer prevent hospitalisations and deaths, but simply delay the inevitable. And so we have to ask ourselves the question: if not now, when? And though both hospitalisations and deaths are sadly rising, these numbers are well within the margins of what our scientists predicted at the outset of the roadmap.  And so it is right to proceed cautiously in the way that we are. But it is also right to recognise that this pandemic is far from over. And that is why I’m afraid it is essential to keep up the system of Test, Trace and Isolate.  I know how frustrating it is for all those who have been affected – or pinged and I want to explain that people identified as contacts of cases are at least five times more likely to be infected than others. And even if they have been vaccinated there is a significant risk that they can still pass the disease on. And so as we go forward I’m afraid the continuing sacrifice of a large minority the continuing sacrifice of those who are being asked to isolate remains important to allow the rest of society to get back to something like normality. And, at this stage, it is simply a consequence of living with Covid and opening up when cases are high in the way that they are. As you know we will be moving on August the 16th to a system of testing rather than isolation for those who are double vaccinated by which time we hope that the wall of immunity in our country will be even higher. And, in the meantime, I want to assure you that we will protect crucial services including the staffing of our hospitals and care homes, the supplies of food, water, electricity and medicines, the running of our trains, the protection of our borders and the defence of our realm, by making sure that a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers to leave isolation solely for this work. But for the vast majority of us, myself included, I’m afraid we do need to stick with this system for now. And, of course, the only reason we are able to open up in this way at all, is that we have vaccinated such a large proportion of the population – and at such speed. It is phenomenal that every adult in the country has now been offered a first dose. But unfortunately that does not mean that every person over 18 has yet had a first dose. So far 96% of over 50s and 83% of 30-50 year olds have taken up the offer in England. But there are still 35 per cent of 18-30 year olds - 3 million people –who are completely unvaccinated. And though we can see the enthusiasm of millions of young people to get their jabs, we need even more young adults to receive a protection that is of immense benefit to your family and friends – and to yourselves. And so I would remind everybody that some of life’s most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination. There are already countries that require you to be double jabbed as a condition of quarantine free travel and that list seems likely to grow.  And we are also concerned – as they are in other countries – by the continuing risk posed by nightclubs. I don’t want to have to close nightclubs again - as they have elsewhere - but it does means nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing and make use of the NHS Covid Pass which shows proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity – as a means of entry. As we said last week, we reserve the right to mandate certification at any point, if it is necessary to reduce transmission. And I should serve notice now that by the end of September - when all over 18s will have had the chance to be double jabbed –we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather. Proof of a negative test will no longer be sufficient. Let me stress - we want people to be able to take back their freedoms as they can today. We want this country to be able to enjoy the fruits of our massive vaccination campaign. But to do that we must remain cautious and we must continue to get vaccinated. And that is why we are asking you to come forward and get your jabs now. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s Levelling Up speech I wish I could tell you that this pandemic that we’re going through was over, I wish I could say that from Monday we could simply throw caution to the winds and behave exactly as we did before we had ever heard of COVID, but what I can say is that if we are careful if we continue to respect this disease and its continuing menace, then it is highly probable – and  on this the scientists are almost all agreed – that the worst of the pandemic is now behind us. There are difficult days and weeks ahead as we deal with the current wave of the delta variant there will be, sadly, more hospitalisations and sadly there will be more deaths but with every day that goes by we build higher the wall of vaccine acquired immunity, a wall that is now higher and stronger in this country than almost anywhere else in the world, and with every day that goes by our economy is slowly and cautiously picking itself up off the floor, businesses are opening their doors, you will see the employment figures this morning, people are slowly coming back to the office and over the next few weeks more and more people will find themselves back on their daily commute and as Andy Haldane of the Bank of England has said – there is every prospect that this country is poised to recover like a coiled spring and it is the mission of this government to ensure that in so far as COVID has entrenched problems and deepened inequalities – we need now work double hard to overturn those inequalities so that as far as possible that everyone everywhere feels the benefits of that recovery and that we build back better across the whole of the UK. We need to say from the beginning that even before the pandemic began the UK had and has a more unbalanced economy than almost all our immediate biggest competitors in Europe and more unbalanced than pretty much every major developed country and when I say unbalanced I mean that for too many people geography turns out to be destiny. Take simple life expectancy – even before covid hit, it is an outrage that a man in Glasgow or Blackpool has an average of ten years less on this planet than someone growing up in Hart in Hampshire or in Rutland why do the people of Rutland live to such prodigious ages? Who knows – but they do. There’s a glaring imbalance- or take university entrance- if you are a child on free school meals in London, you now have more than double the chance of going to university than a child on free school meals growing up outside London. It is an astonishing fact that 31 years after German unification, the per capita GDP of the North East of our country, Yorkshire, the East Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland is now lower than in what was formerly East Germany – and I remember going to former East Germany in 1990, just after the wall had gone down, and I remember being amazed at how far behind west Germany it then was a place of strange little cars with two stroke engines and fake coffee and yet we must be honest with ourselves – to a large extent Germany has succeeded in levelling up where we have not and it is vital to understand that these imbalances and inequalities are found within the regions of the United Kingdom– not just between them. A woman from York has on average a decade longer of healthy life expectancy than a woman from Doncaster 30 miles away – one stop away on the east coast mainline. In York nearly half the working population has a higher education qualification, in Doncaster that figure is only 25 per cent. Why is it that Leeds has 1 in 5 working age people not in work, while in Bradford next door the number is as high as one in three? Why should income per head in Monmouthshire be 50 per cent higher than in Blaenau Gwent? No one believes, I don’t believe, you don’t believe, that there is any basic difference in the potential of babies born across this country. Everyone knows that talent and energy and enthusiasm and flair are evenly spread across the UK, evenly spread,  It is opportunity that is not and it is the mission of this government to unite and level up across the whole UK not just because that is morally right but because if we fail then we are simply squandering vast reserves of human capital we are failing to allow people to fulfil their potential and we are holding our country back and so today I want to talk again about that project of levelling up and to define it more closely and in advance of a white paper later this year that will set out our plan to level up and we should begin by stressing – in all humility - that this is a huge undertaking that many governments have debated about and dabbled in before and though there have been some successes the overall results are disappointing and yet it could be so very different. We don’t need to look at what has happened in the old East Germany which has now overtaken parts of our country, we can look at our own history and the ability of places to recover and regenerate – without natural resources, without discovering gold or oil under their streets and we should never forget that our national capital suffered a 50 year period of decline when its population shrank by as many as two million people between the 1930s and the mid 1980s and the same urban decay was seen in cities around the country and the inequalities were so acute that when I became mayor in 2008 you could travel from Westminster to Canning Town on the jubilee line and lose a year of life expectancy with every stop and yet at the end of my time as mayor that was no longer true- life expectancy had increased across the capital – but the gains had been greatest among the poorest groups and that is what I mean by levelling up. There is much more to do in London, and there are still huge inequalities – but deprivation levels have been dramatically reduced and let us be clear about the difference between this project and levelling down. We don’t want to level down.  We don’t want to decapitate the tall poppies, we don’t think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer and you can’t hope to stimulate growth around the country by actually constraining companies from developing as the Labour government did in the 1960s, with the ludicrous industrial development certificates. Levelling up can only be achieved with a strong and dynamic wealth creating economy. There has got to be a catalytic role for government, and government is there to provide a strategic lead but that requires consistency from government – not chopping and changing - in the last 40 years we have had 40 different schemes or bodies to boost local or regional growth- we had the Abercrombie plan in London, the new towns, the economic development committees, the urban regeneration corporations, the new deal for communities, the regional development agencies, and yet none of these initiatives have been powerful enough to deal with the long term secular trends- de-industrialisation or the decline of coastal resorts and that basic half-heartedness has been coupled with an unspoken assumption by policy makers that investment should always follow success- so that to use a football metaphor the approach has always been to hang around the goal mouth rather than being the playmaker. Or to borrow from the Bible, for  biblical comparison, governments have created a sort of Matthew effect to him that hath shall be given so you end up investing in areas where house prices are already sky high and where transport is already congested and by turbo charging those areas, especially in London and the south east – you drive prices even higher and you force more and more people to move to the same expensive areas- and two thirds of graduates from our top 30 universities end up in London – and the result is that their commutes are longer, their trains are more crowded, they have less time with their kids, they worry at the same time that the younger generation won’t be able to get a home and that their leafy suburb or village will be engulfed by new housing development but without the infrastructure to go with it. And so the process of levelling up is not just aimed at creating opportunity throughout the UK, it is about relieving the pressure in the parts that are overheating and to those who seriously worry that levelling up could in some way be to the detriment of London and the south east let me make some obvious points and I speak as someone who has spent more than a decade now campaigning to extend the lead of London as the greatest city on earth. Does anyone really think it has been bad for London to have the BBC growing and flourishing in Manchester as well?  Is it bad for JP Morgan that they have a back office Bournemouth that is one of the biggest private sector employers in Dorset? That’s not bad for London. Of course not. And it is obvious that greater regional prosperity means more customers and more business for our national metropolis that already leads the world in financial and business services and so many other sectors of the 21st century economy, and so levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation, it’s not robbing Peter to pay Paul, its not zero sum it’s win win for the whole United Kingdom and so here is the plan for levelling up. And I believe we will have made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people’s sense of pride in their community. We’ve got to begin by getting the basics right, begin with fighting crime because we will never level up our country while some kids face the misery of dealing with the county lines drugs gangs, and some kids do not and that is why we are putting rings of steel around towns that are plagued by these gangs – and steadily driving them out and so far we have squeezed more than a thousand of these county lines out of business and that’s why we have tough sentences, we are recruiting 20k more police, and we will be ruthless in fighting crime because it is the poorest and most vulnerable who suffer the most, and to give kids alternatives to these gangs we will invest in grassroots sports of all kinds. And I can today announce another £50 m for football pitches so that we give new opportunity to the stars of the future and so that ultimately you are never more than 15 minutes away from a high quality football pitch and we won’t level up when so many people are sick, or off work because they are stressed, or because they suffer from obesity or problems with their mental health and that’s why we are tackling the problems of junk food and rewarding exercise and that’s why we are building 40 new hospitals and recruiting 50,000 more nurses, and we are going to deal with the backlog of those waiting for elective surgeries and the single biggest thing we can do of course, is investing in public services to change their lives to give them the confidence and the natural serotonin they need to deal with the day is to help them into a good job on decent pay and that means the private sector has to invest to create those jobs and we must create conditions for business confidence and when people look at the west midlands, here where we are today, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, the place that changed the world, they remember that – unbelievably – the number of private sector jobs actually fell three per cent under the last Labour government in the West Midlands, and they know that one of the problems holding the west midlands back has been the lack of mass transit, public transport, the basic difficulty of getting from your home to your place of work  and so that’s why I support the mayor’s plan to put in those new metro lines, and that’s why today I am fulfilling my promise to give eight city regions like the west midlands the funding to start making their bus and train networks as good as London by launching our city region sustainable transport fund with £4.2 billion that local leadership can spend on projects like contactless ticketing new tramlines, bike lanes – massively popular in this country, believe me as part of the biggest infrastructure investments in history. We are spending £640 billion on roads and rail, on housing and clean power generation and we will use the findings of Sir Peter Hendy’s union connectivity review to see how we can strengthen the sinews of the whole United Kingdom getting HS2 trains to Scotland and giving new impetus to projects that benefit the whole country the A1 that links Scotland and England, and the A75 that links Scotland and Northern Ireland, the links into wales along the M4 corridor and the A55 and dozens of other crucial and overdue projects like the A303 to the greater south west.
We have made huge progress in rolling out gigabit broadband throughout the UK. When I became Prime Minister almost exactly two years ago, 7 per cent of the country, that I never tired of saying at the time, had gigabit connection. By the end of the year we will be hitting 60 per cent and that has the potential to revolutionise our patterns of work and provide a tail wind for levelling up and no matter how frustrating we may find a life on zoom we can see how this technology – and its successors – will allow the places that have been left behind to become places that retain their talent, and professionals will be able to stay and bring up their families and enjoy a higher quality of life without the need to move to the supposedly fashionable conurbation and we are also helping young people to fulfil their dream of owning the home they live with our 95 per cent mortgage guarantee and reserving a portion of homes in some new developments for first time buyers at a discount of at least 30 per cent and this government is backing the improvement in the  lives of people growing up in those areas,  with the levelling up fund worth £4.8 billion – to be spent across the whole of Britain – England, Scotland and Wales and with town deals – with another 15 of them announced today, helping local people to renew they live from the civic square in Tilbury to the hippodrome theatre in Todmorden, removing chewing gum and graffiti, breathing new life into town centres through our new High Streets Strategy, published today and though each change may be small the overall effect can be transformed in making that environment attractive as a place to live and bring up a family and to invest and what is the key question that young families ask themselves about a neighbourhood- not just whether it is safe – but whether the schools are good and we need to give all our children the guarantee of a great education with safe and well disciplined classes and fantastic teachers  so we are literally levelling up funding for primary and secondary education, with a higher level of funding per pupil and so that every teacher starts on a salary of £30,000 and we must face the reality that in loss of learning, and loss of life chances, some children have been hit harder by this pandemic than others and so we have put in place the biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world to help them catch up, a catch up programme that is already worth £3 billion that was invested as soon as this government came in. But it is in post 16 education where the differences across our society are the starkest It cannot be right that Bath has 78 per cent with a level three or a level equivalent qualification and Bradford has only 42 per cent, and that is why this government is obsessed with skilling up our population. We love our universities and we believe they are one of the glories of this country but we need to escalate the value of practical and vocational education that can transform people’s lives. And that is why we are rolling out T-levels and apprenticeships because we know that higher level apprentices earn more than the average graduate five years after graduation. That’s why we’re creating the lifetime skills guarantee and so as we improve skills and cut crime and upgrade transport and ensure that gigabit broadband is probing its invisible electronic tendrils into every home in the land and opening limitless vistas of information and opportunity. By that process, we want to make the whole country more attractive for investment.
We are turning this country into a science superpower, doubling public investment in R and D to £22 billion and we want to use that lead to trigger more private sector investment and to level up across the country so that we have hubs or research and innovation like the one we are in today which is actually driving battery technology. This battery industrialisation sector is helping to drive battery technology and we’re going to need huge numbers of these batteries. We need 70,000 skilled individuals to be making the batteries alone. This battery development will drive investment from Cornwall to Thurso, so that without in any way detracting from the golden triangle of Oxford London Cambridge – the greatest scientific constellation anywhere in this hemisphere – we drive high tech high wage jobs across the UK and we will use new post Brexit freedoms – such as freeports – to drive those investments across the UK especially in green technology, from wind turbines to batteries we’ve seen being developed here today, to zero emission   planes to solar to nuclear power , hydrogen – all of which is set out in the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and our new office for investment will land investments and continues to land investments in all parts of the UK, like– Nissan in Sunderland and the new gigafactory for batteries, Stellantis in Ellesmere port, Fujifilm in Teesside,  Ciner Glass in Ebbw vale – all just in the last few weeks. Not forgetting the wise decision of Heinz tomato ketchup to relocate back to Wigan from Holland and now is the time to scrutinise those incentives that we offer against those offered by other countries. Yes business already overwhelmingly chooses Britain and it was good to see the London stock market recover its edge over Amsterdam the other day. But now is the time to do even better and then there is one final ingredient, the most important factor in levelling up, the yeast that lifts the whole mattress of dough, the magic sauce – the ketchup of catch-up and that is leadership and this brings me to the crux of the argument- this country is not only one of the most imbalanced in the developed world, it is also one of the most centralised – and those two defects are obviously connected. We are making progress… we have created metro mayors, I used to be one, and the best of them are relentless champions for their communities like Andy Street and Andy provides the answer to the question of who you going to call in the West Midlands– if you are an EV pioneer- and you want a brownfield site and you want someone who can put together the transport, the skills, the utilities– then you know exactly who to ring- you ring Andy- and already after 20 years of trial and error we are starting to the see the results of this devolution. It is not entirely a coincidence that our great cities that had seemed to be in long term decline are now seeing a resurgence in population and a growth in productivity that outstrips the rest of the country and we need this levelling up to go much further and faster. Because the UK is outstandingly successful in spite of its handicap. If you look at France or other G7 economies the levels of productivity are much more comparable across all their big cities. Imagine if we could level up – not just lengthening London’s lead around the world. but closing the gap between London and the rest of the UK’s great cities. That would increase the national GDP by tens of billions, the opportunities for millions of people and then we should go further. The political geography of this country is as rich and as diverse and as idiosyncratic as the very landscape itself. The UK will never fit into some cookie cutter division into regions named after points of the compass. But where there are obvious communities of identity and affinity and real economic geographies – there is the chance to encourage local leadership and I want to return to this point. It is not just that this country is the most economically imbalanced – it is the most centralised. That’s because for many decades we relentlessly crushed local leadership and we must be honest about why this was necessary, it was because we were in the grip of a real ideological conflict in which irresponsible municipal socialist governments were bankrupting cities and were so genuinely hostile to business in such a way that government was forced to intervene. Now, with some notable exceptions that argument is now over and most of the big metro mayors know that private sector investment is crucial. They know that one of their jobs – for which they will be attacked in their local media – is to get on a plane and go to the big trade and property fairs and hustle for their hometown and today we want to go a step further, because if the big cities are beginning to catch up it is the rest of the country, those historic towns, our shires where local leaders now need to be given the tools to make things happen for their communities and to do that we must now take a more flexible approach to devolution in England. We need to re-write the rulebook, with new deals for the counties. There is no reason why our great counties cannot benefit from the same powers we have devolved to city leaders so that they can take charge of levelling up local infrastructure like the bypass they desperately want to end congestion and pollution and to unlock new job or new bus routes plied by clean green buses because they get the chance to control the bus routes. Or they can level up the skills of the people in their area because they know what local business needs, and they are working with them every day and of course you can see risk and the catch in all this, we have to learn lessons of the last 50 years. Ken Livingstone of the 2000s was a very different creature from Ken Livingstone of the 1980s, but the loony left remains pretty loony and we need accountability. As I say, we will not be proceeding with a one size fits all template. One possibility is a directly elected mayor for individual counties but there are other possibilities. We could devolve power for a specific local purpose like a county or city coming together to improve local services like buses. So my offer to you – and I am talking to all those who see a role for yourselves in this local leadership- come to us, come to Neil O Brien or to me with your vision for how you will level up, back business, attract more good jobs and improve your local services. Come to us with a plan for strong accountable leadership and we will give you the tools to change your area for the better, and it can be done, because there is no intrinsic reason why one part of this country should be fated to decline or indeed fated to succeed. The towns and cities that people say have been left behind have not lacked for human ingenuity, they have not been short of people with courage or intelligence or imagination, and there is no place in this country that does not have something special, something about their scenery or culture or history, some selling point unlike anywhere else in the world and they don’t think that they are left behind and they are right. They think that they are the future or could be the future and they are right about that too, all they need is the right people to believe in them to lead them and to invest in them and for government to get behind them and that is what we are going to do. 

Boris:


I want to set out what our lives would be like from the 19th of this month - which is only a few days away – if and when we move to step 4 - a decision we will finally take on the 12th - and I want to stress from the outset that this pandemic is far from over and it will certainly not be over by 19th. As we predicted in the roadmap we’re seeing cases rise fairly rapidly - and there could be 50,000 cases detected per day by the 19th and again as we predicted, we’re seeing rising hospital admissions and we must reconcile ourselves sadly to more deaths from Covid. In these circumstances we must take a careful and a balanced decision. And there is only one reason why we can contemplate going ahead to step 4 - in circumstances where we’d normally be locking down further – and that’s because of the continuing effectiveness of the vaccine roll-out. When we paused step 4 a few weeks ago, we had two reasons. First, we wanted to get more jabs into people’s arms – and we have, with over 45 million adults now having received a first dose and 33 million a second. That is a higher proportion of the adult population of any European country except Malta, and our expectation remains that by July 19 every adult will have had the chance to receive a first dose and two thirds will have received their second dose. And second, we wanted a bit more time to see the evidence that our vaccines have helped to break the link between disease and death. And as the days have gone by it has grown ever clearer that these vaccines are indeed successful with the majority of those admitted to hospital unvaccinated, and Chris and Patrick will show the data highlighting the greatly reduced mortality that the vaccines have achieved. So, as we come to the fourth step, we have to balance the risks. The risks of the disease which the vaccines have reduced but very far from eliminated. And the risks of continuing with legally enforced restrictions that inevitably take their toll on people’s lives and livelihoods - on people’s health and mental health. And we must be honest with ourselves that if we can’t reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal? And to those who say we should delay again; the alternative is to open up in the winter when the virus will have an advantage or not at all this year. And so again without pre-empting the decision on 12th July, let me set out today our five-point plan for living with Covid in the hope that it will give families and businesses time to prepare. First, we will reinforce our vaccine wall, reducing the dose interval for under 40s from 12 weeks to 8, so that everyone over 18 should be double jabbed by mid-September, in addition to our Autumn programme of booster vaccines for the most vulnerable. Second, we will change the basic tools that we have used to control human behaviour. We will move away from legal restrictions and allow people to make their own informed decisions about how to manage the virus. From Step 4, we will remove all legal limits on the numbers meeting indoors and outdoors. We will allow all businesses to re-open, including nightclubs. We will lift the limit on named visitors to care homes, and on numbers of people attending concerts, theatre, and sports events. We will end the 1 metre plus rule on social distancing, and the legal obligation to wear a face covering, although guidance will suggest where you might choose to do so, especially when cases are rising, and where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet in enclosed places, such as obviously crowded public transport. It will no longer be necessary for government to instruct people to work from home, so employers will be able to start planning a safe return to the workplace. There will be no Covid certificate required as a condition of entry to any venue or event, although businesses and events can certainly make use of certification and the NHS app gives you a Covid pass as one way to show your Covid status. Third, we will continue from Step 4 to manage the virus with a test, trace and isolate system that is proportionate to the pandemic. You will have to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. But we are looking to move to a different regime for fully vaccinated contacts of those testing positive, and also for children. And tomorrow the Education Secretary will announce our plans to maintain key protections but remove bubbles and contact isolation for pupils. Fourth, from Step 4 we will maintain our tough border controls – including the red list – and recognising the protection afforded by two doses of vaccine, we will work with the travel industry towards removing the need for fully vaccinated arrivals to isolate on return from an amber country and the Transport Secretary will provide a further update later this week. Last, we will continue to monitor the data and retain contingency measures to help manage the virus during higher risk periods, such as the winter. But we will place an emphasis on strengthened guidance and do everything possible to avoid re-imposing restrictions with all the costs that they bring. As we set out this new approach, I am mindful that today is the 73rd anniversary of our National Health Service and there could not be a more fitting moment to pay tribute once again to every one of our NHS and social care workers. And the best thing we can do to repay their courage and dedication right now is protect ourselves and others and to get those jabs whenever our turn comes. 

Boris:


I’m very pleased to welcome Angela here on the last of the 22 visits you have made to the UK in your 16 years as German Chancellor. In the course of that time some things have changed beyond recognition, but for much of your tenure it was certainly a tradition, Angela, for England to lose to Germany in international football tournaments and I’m obviously grateful to you for breaking with that tradition, just for once. Nonetheless, one thing that has stayed the same is your commitment to the UK-Germany relationship. As you once said, we share the same values. And we share a lot more than that. Germany is the UK’s second largest trading partner, three-quarters of a million Brits work for German companies or vice versa. More than 21,000 Germans attend UK Universities and one in five people in this country are driving around in a German car. And today Angela and I have agreed to expand those links because we are expanding our youth exchanges, creating a new cultural dialogue and as we speak an energy superhighway is being established between our countries which will enable British tea to be brewed with the harvest of German sunshine and German Bratwurst will be grilled using British wind power. Angela you’ve just addressed the British Cabinet – I hope you enjoyed it- and you’re the first foreign leader to do so this century. And what we’ve also agreed is that from now on the German and UK Cabinets will meet every year to discuss shared issues in the first arrangement of its kind for the UK. Angela, on behalf of the UK, I want to thank you for your truly historic commitment to not just to the UK-German relationship but to global diplomacy more generally. I think over the last year, 18 months in particular, your scientific expertise has been instrumental in guiding the global response to the pandemic, and, as I was saying, a commitment to science and research is something our counties share and want to develop together. It is no coincidence that two of the world’s most successful coronavirus vaccines – Pfizer Biontech and Oxford-AstraZeneca – came out of German and British labs. I’m very proud that today we are establishing the new Herschel Medal for German and British women in Astrophysics in your honour – just one, Angela, of the lasting legacies of your leadership. It’s a great privilege to welcome you here today Angela, over to you. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on the G7 summit I chaired in Carbis Bay and the Nato summit in Brussels. Let me first thank the people of Cornwall, Carbis Bay, St Ives, for welcoming the representatives of the world’s most powerful democracies to their home, an enchanting setting for the first gathering of G7 leaders in two years, the first since the pandemic began, and President Biden’s first overseas visit since taking office. Our aim was to demonstrate how the world’s democracies are ready and able to address the world’s toughest problems, offering solutions and backing them up with concrete action. The G7 will combine our strengths and expertise to defeat Covid, minimise the risk of another pandemic, and build back better, fairer and greener, for the benefit of all. Alongside our partners, the G7 is now engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in history, designed to protect the whole world by the end of next year. My fellow leaders agreed to supply developing countries with another billion doses - either directly or through other channels - of which 100 million will come from the UK. The world’s most popular vaccine was developed here and the express purpose of the deal between the British Government, Oxford University and AstraZeneca  was to create an inoculation that would be easy to store, quick to distribute and available at cost price - or zero profit – to protect as many people as humanly possible. The results are becoming clearer every day: over 500 million Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines have been administered in 168 countries so far, accounting for 96 percent of the doses distributed to developing nations by COVAX, the global alliance that the UK helped to establish. With every passing hour, people are being protected across the world – and lives saved – by the formidable expertise that the UK was able to assemble. But all the efforts of this country and of many others, no matter how generous and far-sighted, would be futile in the face of another lethal virus that might escape our efforts. So the G7 has agreed to support a Global Pandemic Radar to spot new pathogens before they begin to spread, allowing immediate containment, and in case a new virus gets through anyway, our scientists will embark on a mission to develop the ability to create new vaccines, treatments and tests in just 100 days, compared to the 300 required for Covid. Even as we persevere against this virus, my fellow leaders share my determination to look beyond today’s crisis and build back better, greener and fairer. If we can learn anything from this tragedy, we have at least been given a chance to break with the past and do things better and do them differently. This time, as our economies rebound, we must avoid the mistakes we made after the financial crash of 2008 and ensure that everyone benefits from the recovery. The surest way of our future prosperity is to design fair and open rules and standards for the new frontiers of the global economy. So the G7 will devise a fairer tax system for global corporations, reversing the race to the bottom, and strive to ensure that new technology serves as a force for prosperity and hope, strengthening freedom and openness. My fellow leaders will act as one against an increasing injustice – the denial of an education to millions of girls across the world – by working to get another 40 million girls into school by 2025. I am happy to say that the G7 agreed to provide more than half of the $5 billion sought by the Global Partnership for Education to transform the prospects of millions of children in developing countries, and £430 million will come from the UK. Our duty to future generations compels us to protect our planet from catastrophic climate change and every country in the G7 has promised to achieve net zero by 2050 – wiping out our contribution to global warming from that date onwards – and to achieve that target we will halve our carbon emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. The G7 resolved to end any government support for unabated coal-fired power generation overseas, and increase and improve climate finance between now and 2025. We will consecrate 30 percent of our land and sea to nature, protecting vast areas in all their abundance and diversity of life, giving millions of species the chance to recover from the ravages of recent decades. And it is precisely because safeguarding our planet requires global action that the G7 will offer developing countries a new partnership – the Build Back Better World – to help construct new and clean and green infrastructure in a way that is transparent and environmentally responsible. There is no contradiction between averting climate change and creating highly skilled and well paid jobs, both in our country and around the world. We can and will achieve both, by means of a green industrial revolution at home and green infrastructure abroad.
I was honoured to welcome our friends, the leaders of India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa, as guests in Carbis Bay, virtually of course in the case of the prime minister of India. And on Monday, Scott Morrison and I were delighted to reach a free trade agreement between the UK and Australia, creating fantastic opportunities for both our countries, eliminating tariffs on all British exports  - whether Scotch whisky or cars from the Midlands and making it easier for young British people to live and work in Australia.
We’ve also included protections for British farmers over the next 15 years and unprecedented protections and provisions for animal welfare, and this House will of course be able to scrutinise the agreement, once the texts are finalised. This is exactly how Global Britain will help to generate jobs and opportunities at home and level up our whole United Kingdom. Our agreement with Australia is a vital step towards the even greater prize of the UK joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a $9 trillion free trade area embracing the fastest growing economies of the world.
Together with the G7, the countries represented at Carbis Bay comprise a Democratic XI, free nations living on five continents, spanning different faiths and cultures, but united by a shared belief in liberty, democracy and human rights. Those ideals were encapsulated in the Atlantic Charter, agreed by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt in 1941, when Britain was the only surviving democracy in Europe and the very existence of our freedom was in peril.
The courage and valour of millions of people ensured our ideals survived and flourished. Eighty years on, President Biden and I met within sight of HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy’s newest aircraft carrier and the linear successor of the battleship on which the original Charter was devised, and agreed a New Atlantic Charter, encompassing the full breadth of British and American cooperation in science, technology, trade and global security. The surest guarantee of our security is NATO, which protects a billion people in 30 countries, and the summit in Brussels on Monday agreed the wholesale modernisation of the alliance to meet new dangers, including in space and cyberspace, reflecting the priorities of our own Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy.
Britain has the biggest defence budget in Europe, comfortably exceeding the NATO target of 2 percent of national income. We have committed our nuclear deterrent and our cyber capabilities to the alliance and we contribute more troops than any other country to NATO’s deployment to protect Poland and the Baltic states. We do more for the security of our continent than any other European power, showing that we mean it when we say that an attack on any NATO ally shall be considered an attack on all, a pledge that has kept the peace for over 70 years, and which President Biden reaffirmed on behalf of the United States. Together these two summits showed the enduring strength of the Atlantic Alliance and the bonds we treasure with kindred democracies across the globe. They provided the best possible foundation for COP26 in Glasgow in November, when the UK will bring the whole world together in a common cause. They demonstrated how Global Britain creates jobs at home, while striving in unison with our friends for a greener, safer and fairer world. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


When we set out on our roadmap to freedom a few months ago, we were determined to make progress that was cautious but irreversible. And step by step – thanks to the enormous efforts of the British people and the spectacular vaccine roll-out we now have one of the most open economies and societies in this part of the world. And as we have always known and as the February roadmap explicitly predicted – this opening up has inevitably been accompanied by more infection and more hospitalisation. Because we must be clear that we cannot simply eliminate Covid – we must learn to live with it.  And with every day that goes by we are better protected by the vaccines and we are better able to live with the disease. Vaccination greatly reduces transmission and two doses provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness and death. But there are still millions of younger adults who have not been vaccinated and sadly a proportion of the elderly and vulnerable may still succumb even if they have had two jabs. And that is why we are so concerned by the Delta variant that is now spreading faster than the third wave predicted in the February roadmap. We’re seeing cases growing by about 64 per cent per week, and in the worst affected areas, it’s doubling every week. And the average number of people being admitted to hospital in England has increased by 50 per cent week on week, and by 61 per cent in the North West, which may be the shape of things to come. Because we know the remorseless logic of exponential growth and even if the link between infection and hospitalisation has been weakened it has not been severed. And even if the link between hospitalisation and death has also been weakened, I’m afraid numbers in intensive care, in ICU are also rising. And so we have faced a very difficult choice. We can simply keep going with all of step 4 on June 21st even though there is a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue that could otherwise have been avoided. Or else we can give our NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.
And since today I cannot say that we have met all four tests for proceeding with step four, I do think it is sensible to wait just a little longer. By Monday 19th July we will aim to have double jabbed around two thirds of the adult population including everyone over 50, all the vulnerable, all the frontline health and care workers and everyone over 40 who received their first dose by mid-May.
And to do this we will now accelerate the 2nd jabs for those over 40 – just as we did for the vulnerable groups – so they get maximum protection as fast as possible. And we will bring forward our target to give every adult in this country a first dose by 19th July that is including young people over the age of 18 with 23 and 24 year olds invited to book jabs from tomorrow - so we reduce the risk of transmission among groups that mix the most. And to give the NHS that extra time we will hold off step 4 openings until July 19th except for weddings that can still go ahead with more than 30 guests provided social distancing remains in place and the same will apply to wakes. And we will continue the pilot events – such as Euro2020 and some theatrical performances. We will monitor the position every day and if after 2 weeks we have concluded that the risk has diminished then we reserve the possibility of proceeding to Step 4 and full opening sooner. As things stand – and on the basis of the evidence I can see right now – I am confident we will not need any more than 4 weeks and we won’t need to go beyond July 19th. It is unmistakably clear the vaccines are working and the sheer scale of the vaccine roll-out has made our position incomparably better than in previous waves. But now is the time to ease off the accelerator because by being cautious now we have the chance – in the next four weeks – to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions more people. And once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated, which is what we can achieve in a short space of time, we will be in a far stronger position to keep hospitalisations down, to live with this disease, and to complete our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom. 

Boris:


This Summit was the first gathering of G7 leaders – in fact the first gathering of pretty much any leaders – in almost two years. And I know the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfishness and nationalist approaches that have marred the initial global response to the pandemic, and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might into defeating covid for good. And I do hope we have lived up to some of the most optimistic of hopes and predictions I should say I am sorry to hear that, owing to their pre-existing commitments, the England football team are not able to watch this press conference live in the way I’m sure they’d like to. But I hope that, following their resounding victory, they will be able to catch up on the triumphs of the G7 later on. A week ago I asked my fellow leaders to help in preparing and providing the doses we need to help vaccinate the whole world by the end of 2022. I’m very pleased to announce that this weekend leaders have pledged over 1 billion doses - either directly or through funding to COVAX – that includes 100 million from the UK, to the world’s poorest countries – which is another big step towards vaccinating the world. And that’s in addition to everything scientists and governments and the pharmaceutical industry have done so far to roll out one of the largest vaccination programmes in history. And here I want to mention, in particular, the role the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – the world’s most popular vaccine, developed 250 miles from where I’m standing today- by scientists who have rightly been given honours by the Queen this weekend. Today over half a billion people are safe because of the development and production of that vaccine, funded – I may add – by the UK Government. And that number is rising every day. It is popular, of course, because it is being sold at cost to the world and it was designed for ease of use in mind. And because of that act of generosity by AstraZeneca who, just to reiterate, are making zero profit on the production of that vaccine, millions more vaccines have been rolled out to the poorest countries in the world. In fact 96% of the vaccines delivered by the COVAX distribution scheme have been Oxford-AZ. But this weekend our discussions went far beyond defeating the pandemic. We looked towards the great global recovery our countries have committed to lead, and we were clear that we all need to build back better in a way that delivers for all our people and  for the people of the world. And that means preventing a pandemic like this from ever happening again, apart from anything else by establishing a global pandemic radar which will spot new diseases before they get the chance to spread. It means ensuring that our future prosperity benefits all the citizens of our countries and indeed all the citizens of the world. At the G7 Summit this weekend, my fellow leaders helped the Global Partnership for Education - an organisation working to make sure that every child in the world is given the chance of a proper education – reach half of its five-year fundraising goal, including a £430m donation from the UK. It’s an international disgrace that some children in the world are denied the chance to learn and reach their full potential, and I’m very very pleased that the G7 came together to support that cause. Because educating all children, particularly girls, is one of the easiest ways to lift countries out of poverty and help them rebound from the coronavirus crisis. With just one additional year of school a girl’s future earnings can increase by 20%. I’m proud that G7 countries have agreed to get 40 million more girls into school and 20 million more reading by the end of primary school in the next five years, and the money we have raised this week is a fantastic start. But of course the world cannot have a prosperous future if we don’t work together to tackle climate change. Later this year the UK will host the COP26 Summit, which will galvanise global action on fighting climate change and create a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. G7 countries account for 20% of global carbon emissions, and we were clear this weekend that action has to start with us. Carbis Bay is one of the most beautiful places in the world as you can see and it was a fitting setting for the first ever net zero G7 Summit. And while it’s fantastic that every one of the G7 countries has pledged to wipe out our contributions to climate change, we need to make sure we’re achieving that as fast as we can and helping developing countries at the same time. And what unites the countries gathered here this weekend – not just the G7 but Australia, India, South Africa and South Korea who have joined us (I should say in India’s case joined us virtually) not just our resolve to tackle climate change, but also our democratic values. It’s not good enough for us to just rest on our laurels and talk about how important those values are. And this isn’t about imposing our values on the rest of the world. What we as the G7 need to do is demonstrate the benefits of democracy and freedom and human rights to rest of the world. And we can partly achieve that by the greatest feat in medical history - vaccinating the world. We can do that by working together to stop the devastation that coronavirus has produced from ever occurring again. And we can do that by showing the value of giving every girl in the world access to  12 years of quality education. And we can also do that by coming together as the G7 and helping the world’s poorest countries to develop themselves in a way that is clean and green and sustainable I want to thank finally, the police, everyone who helped organised this summit and all the people not just of Carbis bay (who certainly helped us put the carbs into Carbis Bay), but all the wonderful people of Cornwall for their hospitality. It’s been a fantastic summit and I know that all the other delegations would want to express their thanks as well 

Boris:


Can I begin by welcoming you all here to Carbis Bay. It’s genuinely wonderful to see everybody in person, I can’t say what a difference it makes. You’ve all been going through the most wretched pandemic the world has faced for at least our lifetimes. I actually think that this is a meeting that genuinely needs to happen because we need to make sure we learn lessons from the pandemic. We need to make sure we don’t repeat some of the errors that we have made in the course of the last 18 months or so and we put in place what is needed to allow our economies to recover. They have the potential to bounce back very strongly and we have all sorts of reasons to be optimistic, but it is vital that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis, the last big economic recession of 2008 when the recovery was not uniform across all part of society. What’s gone wrong with this pandemic, what risks being a lasting scar, is the inequalities that have been entrenched. We need to make sure that as we recover, we level up across our societies - we need to build back better. I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to do that, because as a G7 we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world. A solution to the problems of climate change in all those ideas, in those technologies, that we’re all addressing. Together I think there is a potential to generate many, many millions of high wage, high skilled jobs and I think that is what the people of our countries now want us to focus on. They want to be sure that we’re beating the pandemic together and discussing how to never have a repeat of what we’ve seen. But also that we’re building back better together. And building back greener. And building back fairer. And building back more equal. Maybe in a more gender neutral, a more feminine, way. So those are some of the objectives we have before us today. Thank you all very, very much. 

Boris:


Good afternoon throughout this pandemic we’ve tried to keep people abreast of the last information as soon as we get it. And since I spoke to you last Monday, we’ve seen further clusters of the B.1.617.2, the variant first observed in India, we’ve seen it especially in Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and some other parts of the country. At this stage there are some important unknowns. We believe this variant is more transmissible than the previous one – in other words it passes more easily from person to person - but we don’t know by how much. I am told that if it’s only marginally more transmissible, we can continue more or less as planned. But if the virus is significantly more transmissible, we are likely to face some hard choices. We are going to be learning a lot more in the coming days and weeks about that. The good news is that so far we have no evidence to suggest our vaccines will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness and hospitalisation. So that means we are in a different position from the last time we face a new variant before Christmas because of the scale of our vaccine roll-out, which PHE estimates has already saved almost 12,000 lives and prevented over 33,000 people from being hospitalised. So I believe we should trust in our vaccines to protect the public whilst monitoring the situation very closely. Because the race between our vaccination programme and the virus may be about to become a great deal tighter. And it’s more important than ever therefore that people get the additional protection of a second dose. So following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we will accelerate remaining second doses to the over 50s and those clinically vulnerable right across the country so they are just eight weeks after the first dose, and if you are in this group the NHS will be in touch with you. We will also prioritise first doses for anyone eligible who has not yet come forwards, including the over 40s - and I urge anyone in those groups to come forwards as soon as you can. At this stage, there is no evidence of increased cases translating into unmanageable pressures on the NHS even in Bolton - and infections, deaths and hospitalisations nationally remain at their lowest levels since last Summer. So – and this is a balanced decision - I do not believe on present evidence that we need to delay our roadmap, and we will proceed with our plan to move to step 3 in England from Monday. But I have to level with you that this could be a serious disruption to our progress and could make it more difficult to move to step 4 in June, and I must again stress we will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe. Our surveillance and data gathering is now so advanced, that if there was a danger of the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure,
we would see the signs in the data very early on and could react in good time, and that gives us the confidence to continue moving forwards for now. But I urge everyone to exercise the greatest caution
because the choices we each make in the coming days will have a material effect on the road ahead. To those living in Bolton and Blackburn, I am very sorry that you are once again suffering from this virus. I know how hard it has been for you, having been in a form of national or local lockdown for longer than almost everywhere else. But now it is more vital than ever that you play your part in stopping the spread. We will not be preventing businesses from reopening on Monday, but we will be asking you to do your bit. Take the vaccine when you can. Get your free, twice-weekly rapid tests. If you do test positive, you must self-isolate – and we’ll provide financial support, to help to those on low incomes to help them do so. And as we move away from living our lives by government rules and as we learn to live with this virus, then, as I said on Monday, we need to make our own decisions about how best to protect ourselves and our loved ones - informed by the risks. And for those living in Bolton and other affected areas, there is now a greater risk from this new variant so I urge you to be extra cautious. Our best chance of suppressing this variant is to clamp down on it where it is and we will be throwing everything we can at this task. Colonel Russ Miller – Commander of the North West Region - will be deployed to support local leaders in managing the response on the ground. There will be surge testing, with mobile testing units, and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. And there will targeted new activity in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate vaccine take-up among eligible cohorts – including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. And to everyone across the whole country, wherever you live, please get tested twice a week for free, get a jab if you are eligible, remember hands, face, space and fresh air observe social distancing from those you do not know, and if you are seeing loved ones think really carefully about the risk to them especially if they have not had that second dose – or it hasn’t yet had the time to take full effect. I want us to trust people to be responsible and to do the right thing. That’s the way to live with this virus, while protecting our NHS and restoring our freedoms. And it’s very clear now we are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus as well for some time. So let’s work together – and let’s exercise caution and common sense. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will update the House on our response to Covid. The patience and hard work of the British people has combined with the success of the vaccination programme to reduce deaths and hospitalisations to their lowest levels since last July, and from Monday, England will ease lockdown restrictions in line with step 3 of our roadmap. This will amount to the single biggest step of our journey back to normality. But after everything we have endured, we must be vigilant because the threat of this virus remains real and new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here in the UK. So caution has to be our watchword. Our country - like every country – has found itself in the teeth of the gravest pandemic for a century, imposing heart-breaking sorrow on families across the world with more than 127,000 lives lost in our United Kingdom alone. And our grief would have been still greater without the daily heroism of the men and women of our National Health Service, the protection of our vaccines, already in the arms of over two-thirds of adults across the UK - and the dedication of everyone who has followed the rules and sacrificed so much that we cherish. Amid such tragedy, the State has an obligation to examine its actions as rigorously and candidly as possible, and to learn every lesson for the future, which is why I have always said that when the time is right there should be a full and independent inquiry. So Mr Speaker, I can confirm today that the Government will establish an independent public inquiry on a statutory basis, with full powers under the Inquiries Act of 2005, including the ability to compel the production of all relevant materials, and take oral evidence in public, under oath. In establishing the Inquiry, we will work closely with the Devolved Administrations as we have done throughout our pandemic response, and My Right Honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has this morning spoken to the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland to begin those conversations. Every part of our United Kingdom has suffered the ravages of this virus, and every part of the State has pulled together to do battle against it, and if we are to recover as one Team UK – as we must - then we should also learn lessons together in the same spirit. So we will consult the devolved administrations before finalising scope and detailed arrangements, so that this Inquiry can consider all key aspects of the UK response. Mr Speaker, this process will place the State’s actions under the microscope, and we should be mindful of the scale of that undertaking and the resources required to do it properly. The exercise of identifying and disclosing all relevant information, the months of preparation and retrospective analysis, and the time that people will have to spend testifying in public, in some cases for days, will place a significant burden on our NHS, on the whole of government, on our scientific advisers, and on many others. We must not inadvertently divert and distract the very people on whom we all depend in the heat of our struggle against this disease. And the end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic. The World Health Organisation has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year. Our own scientific advisers judge that although more positive data is coming in and the outlook is improving, there could still be another resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths. We also face the persistent threat of new variants, and should these prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January.
And there is in any case a high likelihood of a surge this Winter when the weather assists the transmission of all respiratory diseases and the pressure on our NHS is most acute. So I expect the right moment for the inquiry to begin is at the end of this period, in the Spring of next year, Spring 2022 Mr Speaker, I know there will be some in this Chamber and many bereaved families – who will be anxious for an Inquiry to begin sooner. So let me reassure the House, that we are fully committed to learning lessons at every stage of this crisis. We have already subjected our response to independent scrutiny including seventeen reports by the independent National Audit Office and fifty parliamentary inquiries - and we will continue to do so. We will continue to learn lessons as we have done throughout the pandemic. But no public inquiry could take place fast enough to assist in the very difficult judgements which will remain necessary throughout the rest of this year and the remainder of the pandemic. And we must not weigh down the efforts of those engaged in protecting us every day, thereby risk endangering further lives. Instead this Inquiry must be able to look at the events of the last year in the cold light of day - and identify the key issues that will make a difference for the future. Free to scrutinise every document, To hear from all the key players, and analyse and learn from the breadth of our response. That is the right way, I think, to get the answers that the people of this country deserve, And to ensure our United Kingdom is better prepared for any future pandemic. Mr Speaker, entirely separately from the Inquiry, there is a solemn duty on our whole United Kingdom to come together and cherish the memories of all those who have been lost. Like many across this Chamber, I was deeply moved when I visited the Covid Memorial Wall opposite Parliament, and I wholeheartedly support the plan for a Memorial in St Paul’s Cathedral, which will provide a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital. I also know that communities across our whole country will want to find ways of commemorating what we have all been through. So the Government will support their efforts by establishing a UK Commission on Covid Commemoration. This national endeavour - above party politics - will remember the loved ones we have lost; honour the heroism of those who saved lives and the courage of frontline workers who kept our country going; celebrate the genius of those who created the vaccines; and commemorate the small acts of kindness and the daily sacrifice of millions who stayed at home, buying time for our scientists to come to our rescue. We will set out the Commission membership and terms of reference in due course. And in telling the whole story of this era in our history, we will work again across our United Kingdom, together with the Devolved Administrations, to preserve the spirit which has sustained us in the gravest crisis since the Second World War, resolving to go forwards together, Mr Speaker, and to build back better. And I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I want to begin by thanking everyone again for your patience and for the sacrifices you’ve been making - businesses, pubs and restaurants that have been waiting to welcome customers back through their doors grandparents who have gone for months without seeing their grandchildren, weddings postponed, funerals sadly constrained, and religious festivals – such as Eid – yet again facing restrictions. And I want to thank you because your efforts have so visibly paid off giving us the time to vaccinate more than two thirds of all adults across the UK with more than one third – nearly 18 million people - also receiving their second dose – and thereby unquestionably saving many lives. So it is precisely because of your efforts, that I can confirm today we have met our four tests for further easing the lockdown in England. Chris will run through the details in a minute, but with deaths and hospitalisations at their lowest levels since last July, and the UK’s four Chief Medical Officers today agreeing a reduction in the alert level, the data now support moving to step 3 in England from next Monday 17th May. This means the Rule of Six or two households that has applied outdoors, will now apply indoors and the limit for outdoor meetings will increase to 30. From next Monday you will be able to sit inside a pub and inside a restaurant. You’ll be able to go to the cinema and children will be able to use indoor play areas. We’re re-opening hostels, hotels, and B&amp;Bs. We’ll re-open the doors of our theatres, concert halls and business conference centres and unlock the turnstiles of our sports stadia, subject to capacity limits. And from next week everyone will be able to travel within Britain and stay overnight, meaning schools will also be able to organise trips with overnight stays. We will no longer require face coverings in classrooms – or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. All remaining University students will be able to return to in-person teaching, where they should be tested twice a week. We will increase the number of named visitors for those in care homes from two to five, and residents will have greater freedoms to leave their home without having to isolate on their return. This unlocking amounts to a very considerable step on the road back to normality and I am confident we will be able to go further. Subject to the impact of step 3 on the data, we remain on track to move to step 4 on 21st June and to give businesses more time to prepare, we’ll be saying more later this month about exactly what the world will look like and what role there could be – if any – for certification and social distancing. And today we are taking a step towards that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid – when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts, and make our own decisions – based on the best scientific advice - about how to protect our families and those around us. So from next Monday we are updating the guidance on close contact between friends and family, setting out the risks for everyone to make their own choices. This does not mean we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. In fact, more than a year into this pandemic, we all know that close contact, such as hugging, is a direct way of transmitting this disease. So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones - whether they have had a vaccine, one or two doses, and whether there has been time for that vaccine to take effect. Remember outdoors is always safer than indoors. And if you are meeting indoors, remember to open a window and let in the fresh air. Keep getting tested regularly, even if you don’t have symptoms, so you don’t spread the virus without knowing it. And whatever you decide, I must ask that you continue to follow social distancing when not with friends and family including in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings. We only have to look at the very sad situation in other countries to see the lethal potential of this virus and we must continue to fight the spread of variants here in the UK. While we have no evidence yet to believe these variants are completely vaccine resistant, we must remain vigilant. So please remember hands, face, space and fresh air. And as we mark Mental Health Awareness week, perhaps also take a moment to check in on friends and family and see how they are doing after all that we have been through together, or if you are struggling yourself, get the support you need. Today we are announcing the single biggest step on our roadmap and it will allow us to do many of the things we’ve yearned to do for a long time. So let’s protect these gains by continuing to exercise caution and common sense. 

Boris:


I’d like to begin by thanking President Biden very much for bringing us together today in the way that he has and for setting out the problem in the eloquent way that he did at the beginning, and of course for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change. I’m really thrilled by the game-changing announcement that Joe Biden has just made. And I’m proud that the UK is doing the same. We were first country to pass legislation for net zero. We have the biggest offshore wind capacity of any country in the world, the Saudi Arabia of wind as I never tire of saying. We’re halfway to net zero. We have carbon emissions lower than at any point since the 19th century, we’re ending support for fossil fuels overseas and doubling our international climate finance. We’re actually speeding up because we see the obligations for developed countries to do more, we’re legislating to deliver 78% of the reductions needed to reach that goal by 2035. As host of COP26, we want to see similar ambitions around the world and we’re working with everybody, from the smallest nations to the biggest emitters to secure commitments that will keep change to within 1.5 degrees. And I think we can do it. And to do it we need the scientists and all of our countries to work together to produce the technological solutions that humanity is going to need.
Whether it’s carbon capture and storage or solving the problems of cheap hydrogen delivery or getting to jet zero flying, getting to net zero flying, making sure that we can roll out EVs properly, making sure that our homes stop emitting such prodigious quantities of CO2, moving to sustainable domestic living. We can do this together across the world. It’s going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100 billion commitment that they already made in 2009 and I stress how important that is. Plus, I think what President Xi had to say about the harmony with nature was absolutely vital. If we’re going to tackle climate change sustainably, we have to deal with the disaster of habitat loss and species loss across our planet and we want to see even more examples of government and private industry working hand in hand as with the newly launched LEAF Coalition to reduce deforestation and the multi-trillion dollar Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. To do these things we’ve got to be constantly original and optimistic about new technology and new solutions whether that’s crops that are super-resistant to drought or more accurate weather forecasts  like those we hope to see from the UK’s new Met Office 1.2bn supercomputer that we’re investing in. I’m not saying any of this is going to be easy. There is obviously going to be a political challenge. It’s important to go back to the original words of President Biden, it’s vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive politically correct green act of ‘bunny hugging’ or however you want to put it. Nothing wrong with ‘bunny hugging’ but you know what I’m driving at. This is about growth and jobs and the President was absolutely right to stress that. I want to leave you with the thought that we can build back better from this pandemic by building back greener. Don’t forget that the UK has been able to cut our own CO2 emissions by about 42% on 1990 levels and we’ve seen our economy grow by 73%,  you can do both at once. Cake have eat is my message to you. Let’s work together on this. Let’s go to Kunming in October and Glasgow in November armed with ambitious targets and the plans required to reach them. And let’s use this extraordinary moment and the incredible technology that we’re working on to make this decade the moment of decisive change in the fight against climate change and let’s do it together. 

Boris:


Thank you very much for joining us. I’m joined today by Dr Nikki Kanani. There is no doubt at all that this country is continuing to make progress in the fight against Covid. We are proceeding with our roadmap and I want to thank everybody for continuing to follow the guidance and to thank parents and families for the incredible work you are doing to help test pupils through the Easter holidays and to encourage you to keep testing them twice a week as schools return.
And above all I want to thank everybody involved in the outstanding vaccine roll-out especially those of you coming forwards in huge numbers as you are. 19 out of 20 of those who’ve had a first dose are coming forward for a second meaning that almost 1 in 5 of all adults have now had a second dose. And on first jabs we’ve now vaccinated 33 million people including 60 per cent of the 45-49 year olds. And we know that this vaccination programme is making a big difference. We know that it’s helping to reduce suffering and save lives potentially on a very big scale. But we don’t yet know the full extent of the protection that we are building up the exact strength of our defences – and as we look at what is happening in other countries with cases now at record numbers around the world, we cannot delude ourselves that Covid has gone away. I see nothing in the data now that makes me think we are going to have to deviate in any way from the roadmap cautious but irreversible that we have set out. But the majority of scientific opinion in this country is still firmly of the view that there will be another wave of covid at some stage this year and so we must – as far as possible – learn to live with this disease, as we live with other diseases. We will be bolstering our defences with booster jabs this Autumn, we’ll be continuing with testing, and today I want to announce what we hope will be a further line of medical defence. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to pioneer dexamethasone, which has saved a million lives globally. And today we are creating a new Antivirals Task Force to search for the most promising new medicines and support their development through clinical trials with the aim of making them safely and rapidly available as early as the Autumn. This means, for example, that if you test positive there might be a tablet you could take at home to stop the virus in its tracks and significantly reduce the chance of infection turning into more severe disease.
Or if you’re living with someone who has tested positive, there might be a pill you could take for a few days to stop you getting the disease yourself. And by focussing on these antivirals we hope to lengthen the UK’s lead in life sciences and to give ever greater confidence to the people of this country that we can continue on our path towards freedom. We have a taken a big step again this month, reopening significant parts of our country again, and for many people this last week has brought the first glimmerings of a return to normality having a pint, having a haircut, making that trip to the shops. Every day science is helping us to get back towards normality and I believe that antiviral treatments can play an important part. And if we keep going, follow the rules remember hands, face, space, fresh air – then we can keep each other safe and see through our roadmap to reclaim our lives in full. 

Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s statement on the death of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh It was with great sadness that a short time ago I received word from Buckingham Palace that His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh has passed away at the age of 99. Prince Philip earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth and around the world. He was the longest serving consort in history, one of the last surviving people in this country to have served in the second world war at Cape Matapan, where he was mentioned in despatches for bravery and in the invasion of Sicily, where he saved his ship by his quick thinking and from that conflict he took an ethic of service that he applied throughout the unprecedented changes of the post war era. Like the expert carriage driver that he was he helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life. He was an environmentalist, and a champion of the natural world long before it was fashionable. With his Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme he shaped and inspired the lives of countless young people and at literally tens of thousands of events he fostered their hopes and encouraged their ambitions. We remember the Duke for all of this and above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty The Queen. Not just as her consort, by her side every day of her reign, but as her husband, her “strength and stay”, of more than 70 years. And it is to Her Majesty, and her family, that our nation’s thoughts must turn today. Because they have lost not just a much-loved and highly respected public figure, but a devoted husband and a proud and loving father, grandfather and, in recent years, great-grandfather. Speaking on their golden wedding anniversary, Her Majesty said that our country owed her husband “a greater debt than he would ever claim or we shall ever know” and I am sure that estimate is correct. So we mourn today with Her Majesty The Queen we offer our condolences to her and to all her family and we give thanks, as a nation and a Kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I hope you’re all continuing to enjoy the Easter break, and I know that over this weekend millions of people have been able to see loved ones for the first time in months. And I want to thank you all again for your patience, because it is really clear now that this is paying off. And it your collective efforts, our collective efforts, that has given us that crucial time and space to vaccinate more than 31 million people. And I’m pleased that we’ve also been able to support our overseas territories so that Gibraltar has become one of the first places in the world to offer a vaccination to its entire adult population. And the net result of your efforts and the vaccine roll-out is that I can today confirm that from Monday 12th April, we will move to Step Two of our roadmap - re-opening shops, gyms, zoos, holiday campsites, personal care services like hairdressers and, of course, beer gardens and outdoor hospitality of all kinds. And on Monday the 12th I will be going to the pub myself - and cautiously but irreversibly raising a pint of beer to my lips. We’re also increasing the number of visitors to care homes from one to two – to allow residents to see more of their loved ones. We think that these changes are fully justified by the data which show we are meeting our four tests for easing the lockdown as Chris will shortly explain. But – and you know I’m going to say this – we can’t be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries and we’ve seen how this story goes. We still don’t know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as I’m afraid that they will – and that’s why we’re saying: Please get your vaccine or your second dose when your turn comes. And please use the free NHS tests – even if you don’t feel ill, because remember 1 in 3 people with this virus doesn’t have any symptoms - and you can get these tests from pharmacies or your local test site, you can even order them on gov.uk and get home deliveries. As part of our roadmap we’re also publishing today on gov.uk the early thinking on our four reviews, on the safe return of major events, on social distancing, the potential role of Covid status certification, and on the resumption of international travel. We set out our roadmap and we’re sticking to it. And I want to stress, that we see nothing in the present data that makes us think that we will have to deviate from that roadmap. But it is by being cautious, by monitoring the data at every stage and by following the rules: remembering hands, face, space and fresh air - that we hope together to make this roadmap to freedom irreversible. 

Boris:


Good afternoon and welcome to this press conference on what has been a big day for many of us – with the first chance to see friends and family outdoors, whether as six people or two households. And I want to congratulate the members of Ilkeston cycling club in Derbyshire that set off at midnight, the swimmers who broached the chilly waters of the Hillingdon Lido at the crack of dawn, and more than anything I know how much it will have meant to millions of people to have joined someone else for a cup of tea in the garden. And I must stress that it is only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step to freedom today. And we must proceed with caution. It is great to see that yesterday we recorded the lowest number of new infections for six months deaths and hospital admissions across the UK are continuing to fall. But that wave is still rising across the Channel and it is inevitable as we advance on this roadmap that there will be more infections, and unavoidably more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths. So what we need to do is continue flat out to build the immunity of our population build our defences against that wave when it comes. And now that we have vaccinated more than 30 million adults across the United Kingdom it is more vital than ever to protect the most vulnerable. the evidence seems pretty clear that vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable has helped to drive down rates of hospitalisation and death and now we want to reinforce that protection with a second dose so for many people April will be the “Second Dose Month” and please take up your appointment when it’s your turn. And at the same time as we push forwards with our programme to offer a vaccination to all adults by the end of July we’re building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities. I’ve already told you that Novavax – a potentially significant new weapon in our armoury against Covid - is going to be made at Fujifilm in the North East. And I can today announce that the Vaccine Task Force has reached an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to finish and bottle this precious fluid also in the North East giving us between 50 and 60 million doses of UK made vaccine subject to the right approvals from the MHRA. And then, of course, there is one other way we can all build our own individual defences against Covid and enjoy ourselves at the same time – and that is to take more exercise. So I am personally thrilled that I will be able to play tennis for instance And without being remotely preachy I do hope that we can take advantage of this moment and the beautiful weather – to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience in that way too. And remember that outdoors is generally much safer than indoors and the way to continue on our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom is to follow the rules and remember hands, face, space and fresh air. 

Boris:


Good afternoon everybody, thank you for joining us, When I asked you to go into lockdown exactly a year ago it seemed incredible that in the 21st Century this was the only way to fight a new respiratory disease - to stay at home to avoid human contact to shun so many of the patterns of behaviour that are most natural and obvious to all of us. But we did it together to protect the NHS to save lives. And for the entire British people it has been an epic of endurance and privation, of children’s birthday parties cancelled of weddings postponed of family gatherings of all kinds simply deleted from the diary. And worst of all in that time We’ve suffered so many losses and for so many people our grief has been made more acute because we have not been able to see our loved ones in their final days to hold their hands or even to mourn them together. And at the right moment, we will come together as a country to build a fitting and a permanent memorial to the loved ones we have lost and to commemorate this whole period. For month after month our collective fight against Coronavirus was like fighting in the dark against a callous and invisible enemy, until science helped us to turn the lights on and to gain the upper hand. And I want to renew my thanks to everyone responsible for the astounding vaccine roll-out which has enabled us to protect more than 28 million people across the whole of the United Kingdom with a first jab and administer more than 30 million doses in total. And I want to thank everybody for their courage, your courage, discipline and patience. When people come to describe this epidemic to future generations, we’ll tell the story of the heroes of the NHS and social care of pharmacists, teachers, armed service personnel, shop workers, transport workers, the police and so many others. But in the end this was unlike any other struggle in my lifetime, in that our entire population has been engaged, and it’s thanks to all of you therefore that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom. We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of the vaccine to every adult by the end of July. And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab, this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms. 

Boris:


Our roadmap to freedom depends on the continued success of our vaccination programme, and so it is reasonable for people to want to be continually reassured not only that our vaccines are safe and effective but also that we have the supply that we need. So I want to address both points today especially in the light of concerns you may have heard in some other countries about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. First, the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has reviewed the evidence, as it does every week. They have confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID far outweigh any risks and people should continue to get their vaccine when asked to do so and June will say a little bit more about that in a moment. It’s also very important for our European friends that today the European Medicines Agency has come to a clear scientific conclusion and I quote - “this is a safe and effective vaccine.” We also saw yesterday the evidence from Public Health England that a single dose of either vaccine provides 60 per cent protection against getting COVID. and reduces the chances of hospitalisation by 80 per cent and the risk of death by 85 per cent. So the Oxford jab is safe; and the Pfizer jab is safe – the thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid – which is why it’s so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes. And as it happens, I’m getting mine tomorrow. And the centre where I’m getting jabbed is currently using the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for those receiving their first dose, and that is the one I’ll be having. And let me also assure you – if you come forwards after receiving your letter, we have the jabs for you. We’ve always said that in a vaccination programme of this pace and this scale, some interruptions in supply are inevitable and it is true that in the short term we are receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago. That is because of a delay in a shipment from the Serum Institute who are doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities - and because of a batch that we currently have in the UK that needs to be retested – as part of our rigorous safety programmes. So as a result we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March. But that is still more than we received in February and the supply we do have will still enable us to hit the targets we have set. That means that by 15 April we will be able to offer a first dose to all of you who are over 50, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable. We will have the second doses that people need within the 12 week window – which means around        12 million people in April. And we will still offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July. So there is no change to the next steps of the roadmap. We’ve now vaccinated over 25 million across our entire United Kingdom – more than the entire population of many countries and our progress along the road to freedom continues unchecked. We remain on track to reclaim the things we love, to see our families and friends again, to return to our local pubs, our gyms and sports facilities, and of course our shops, all as long as the data continue to go in the right direction and we meet our four tests. And the way to ensure this happens is to get that jab when your turn comes. So let’s get the jab done! Thank you very much. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on the government’s Integrated Review of security, defence, development and foreign policy, which we are publishing today. The overriding purpose of this Review - the most comprehensive since the Cold War – is to make the United Kingdom stronger, safer and more prosperous while standing up for our values. Our international policy is a vital instrument for fulfilling this government’s vision of uniting and levelling up across our country, reinforcing the Union, and securing Britain’s place as a science superpower and a hub of innovation and research. The Review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values. We will be more dynamic abroad and more focused on delivering for our citizens at home. I begin with the essential fact that the fortunes of the British people are almost uniquely interlinked with events on the far side of the world. With limited natural resources we have always earned our living as a maritime trading nation. In 2019 the UK sold goods and services overseas worth £690 billion 
fully a third of our GDP, sustaining millions of jobs and livelihoods everywhere from Stranraer to St Ives -

and making our country the fifth biggest exporter in the world. Between 5 and 6 million Britons – nearly one in ten of us - live permanently overseas, including 175,000 in the Gulf and nearly two million in Asia and Australasia. So a crisis in any of those regions, or in the trade routes connecting them, would be a crisis for us from the very beginning. The truth is that even if we wished it – and of course we don’t– the UK could never turn inwards or be content with the cramped horizons of a regional foreign policy. For us, there are no faraway countries of which we know little. Global Britain is not a reflection of old obligations, still less a vainglorious gesture, but a necessity for the safety and prosperity of the British people in the decades ahead. I am determined that the UK will join our friends to ensure that free societies flourish after the pandemic, sharing the risks and burdens of addressing the world’s toughest problems. The UK’s presidency of the G7 has already produced agreement to explore a global Treaty on Pandemic Preparedness, working through the World Health Organisation to enshrine the steps that countries will need to take to prevent another COVID. We will host COP-26 in Glasgow in November and rally as many nations as possible behind the target of Net Zero by 2050, leading by example since the UK was the first major economy to accept this obligation in law. Britain will remain unswervingly committed to NATO and preserving peace and security in Europe, and from this secure basis, we will seek out friends and partners wherever they can be found, building a coalition for openness and innovation, and engaging more deeply in the Indo-Pacific. I have invited the leaders of Australia, South Korea and India to attend the G7 summit in Carbis Bay in June, and I am delighted to announce that I will visit India next month to strengthen our friendship with the world’s biggest democracy. Our approach will place diplomacy first and the UK has applied to become a dialogue partner of the Association of South East Asian Nations and we will seek to join the Trans-Pacific free trade agreement. But all our international goals rest upon keeping our people safe at home and deterring those who would do us harm. So we will create a Counter-Terrorism Operations Centre, bringing together our ability to thwart the designs of terrorists, while also dealing with the actions of hostile states. It is almost exactly three years since the Russian state used a chemical weapon in Salisbury, killing an innocent mother, Dawn Sturgess, and bringing fear to a tranquil city. I can announce that the National Cyber Force, which conducts offensive cyber operations against terrorists, hostile states and criminal gangs, will in future be located in a cyber corridor in the North West of England. And we will also establish a cross-government Situation Centre in the Cabinet Office, learning the lessons of the pandemic and improving our use of data to anticipate and respond to future crises. The first outcome of the Integrated Review was the government’s decision to invest an extra £24 billion in defence, allowing the wholesale modernisation of our armed forces and taking forward the renewal of our nuclear deterrent. The new money will be focused on mastering the emerging technologies that are transforming warfare, reflecting the premium placed on speed and deployment and technical skill, and my Right Honourable Friend the Defence Secretary will set out the details next week. Later this year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will embark on her maiden deployment, leading a carrier strike group on a 20,000-mile voyage to the Indo-Pacific and back, exercising with Britain’s allies and partners along the way, and demonstrating the importance that we attach to freedom of the seas. By strengthening our armed forces, we will extend British influence while simultaneously creating jobs across the United Kingdom, reinforcing the Union, and maximising our advantage in science and technology. This government will invest more in research and development than any of our predecessors because innovation is the key to our success at home and abroad, from speeding our economic recovery, to shaping emerging technologies in accordance with freedom and openness. We will better protect ourselves against threats to our economic security. Our newly independent trade policy will be an instrument for ensuring that the rules and standards in future trade agreements reflect our values. Our newly independent sanctions policy already allows the UK to act swiftly and robustly wherever necessary and we were the first European country to sanction the generals in Myanmar after the coup last month. In all our endeavours, the United States will be our greatest ally and a uniquely close partner in defence, intelligence and security. Britain’s commitment to the security of our European home will remain unconditional and immoveable, incarnated by our leadership of NATO’s deployment in Estonia. We shall stand up for our values as well as for our interests - and here I commend the vigilance and dedication of Hon Members from all parties. The UK, with the wholehearted support of this whole House, has led the international community in expressing our deep concern over China’s mass detention of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province, and in giving nearly three million of Hong Kong’s people a route to British citizenship. There is no question that China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours. But we will also work with China where that is consistent with our values and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship and in addressing climate change. The greater our unity at home, the stronger our influence abroad, which will, in turn, open up new markets and create jobs in every corner of the UK, not only maximising opportunities for the British people but also, I hope, inspiring a sense of pride that their country is willing to follow in its finest traditions and stand up for what is right. With the extra investment and new capabilities of the Integrated Review, I believe the United Kingdom can thrive in an ever more competitive world, and fulfil our historic mission as a force for good, and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Good afternoon this has been a big day and an emotional day for millions of families up and down the country as children see – and play with – their friends for the first time in months. And although I know that some will have been anxious as pupils always are on the first day of term – I also know that the overwhelming feeling is one of relief. And we all know that the education of our children is so important that the greater risk now is keeping them out of school for a day longer. I want to thank all the teachers who have got their schools ready and who have been teaching throughout the whole period – whether that’s remotely or in person - your work has been astonishing. And I want to thank the parents and all those who have been teaching at home who have had to master Zoom who’ve had to communicate every detail of the syllabus from fronted adverbials to quadratic equations. And we all know that the burden has disproportionately fallen on women, often holding down jobs and providing childcare at the same time. So our job now as government is to build on your efforts so that from now on our school children not only catch up on lost learning but take the biggest possible step forwards with a concerted national programme for educational recovery. It is thanks to all of you parents, teachers, pupils – thanks to this huge national effort to keep kids at home that we have been able significantly to reduce the spread of the virus. And so today we have been able to take that crucial first step on what we hope is our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom Today allowing people to meet one-on-one outside for the first time in months, allowing care home visits to take place with all appropriate precautions. And this first step on the road map is made possible above all by our NHS which has now vaccinated more than one third of the entire UK population. And we take this first step with confidence because all four of the most vulnerable groups have not only been vaccinated in overwhelming numbers but it is now at least three weeks since they received their first dose and so they will be feeling the full benefits of the vaccine protection. We will continue on this roadmap but we must remember that today’s return to schools will of course have an impact on the spread of the virus and so at all times and as we decide on the next steps when we take them we will be driven by the data, and with the number of patients being admitted to hospital with Covid each day still around eight times higher than the lows of last Summer, it is more vital than ever to follow the rules. Hands, face, space, and please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


Good evening, Our extraordinary NHS has now succeeded in vaccinating more than 17.7 million people across the United Kingdom and nearly a year after the pandemic began This unparalleled national effort has decisively shifted the odds in our favour so that we no longer have to rely simply on lockdowns and restricting our behaviour and putting our lives on hold But with every day that goes by this programme of vaccination is creating a shield around the entire population which means that we are now travelling on a one way road to freedom. And we can begin safely to restart our lives and do it with confidence. But I want to be frank about exactly what that means and the trade-offs involved. The vaccines reduce the danger of Covid: they save lives and they keep people out of hospital. But no vaccine against any disease has ever been 100 per cent effective. So whenever we ease the lockdown, whether it is today or in six or nine months, We’ve got to be realistic and accept that there will be more infections, more hospitalisations and therefore – sadly - more deaths, just as there are every year with flu. Even if we sustained the lockdown indefinitely, which would itself cost lives and do immeasurable harm to our children, we would not be able to eradicate this disease. And that’s why it’s right gradually to replace the protection afforded by the lockdown with the protection of the vaccines, and our approach is to move with the utmost care, and advancing in four steps, each with a minimum of five weeks apart so we can fully judge the impact of each relaxation before we move on, and you can see the details of all of this on gov.uk. And we will be led at every stage by data not dates, and we will apply four tests: the pace of the vaccination programme; the effectiveness of the vaccines; the pressure on the NHS; and the risks of any new variants of Covid. And therefore as we look at the data today, I can confirm that two weeks from today – Monday 8th March – we will begin step one and schools and colleges across England will re-open and teaching in classrooms can start again.
All the evidence shows that schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small.
But to offer even greater reassurance, we are introducing twice-weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils and asking them to wear face coverings for the rest of this term.
Students on practical courses can return to university, but all others will need to continue learning online and we will review the situation before the end of the Easter holidays.
We will allow breakfast and afterschool clubs to restart and among other changes on 8 March, you’ll be able to have a coffee on a bench or a picnic in a park with one person outside your household. And because we know how stressful this time has been and how people yearn to see friends and family if only fleetingly we will now go further and on 29 March, you can meet more of your friends and family outside, including in gardens – either as two households or subject to the Rule of Six. And then we will go to step two – which is no earlier than 12 April – when shops will return and re-open, hairdressers, nail salons will reopen pubs and restaurants will all be able to serve customers outside – precisely because we know the risk of outside transmission is lower. And then five weeks after that, no earlier than 17 May, we will go to step three and open all our hospitality sector to service indoors pubs, bars, restaurants, along with hotels and cinemas, and, subject to capacity limits, we will also open sports stadia, concert halls and theatres. And finally - provided we continue to pass the four tests - then from 21 June we will go to step four and say goodbye to most remaining restrictions: resuming large-scale events like business conferences and football matches, lifting the limits on weddings and reopening nightclubs. All of these steps will apply in England, and the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across our whole United Kingdom for the duration of the pandemic. I know there are some who would like to accelerate this timetable and I know of course there are others who would like to be more cautious and stay in the slow lane. I understand and sympathise with both of those points of view because levels of infection are still high and we must strike a very careful balance and always accept we must be humble in the face of nature. But also, we must accept that we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that have separated families and loved ones for too long, and threatened the livelihoods of millions, and kept pupils out of school. It is thanks to the roll-out of the vaccinations, some of them pioneered in this country that the balance of that judgement is now changing in our favour. And it is thanks to the vaccinations that there is light ahead leading us to a spring and summer which I think will be seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all and from which we will not go back. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a Statement on the roadmap that will guide us cautiously but irreversibly – towards reclaiming our freedoms while doing all we can to protect our people against Covid. Today’s measures will apply in England, but we are working closely with the Devolved Administrations who are setting out similar plans. The threat remains substantial, with the numbers in hospital only now beginning to fall below the peak of the first wave in April. But we are able to take these steps because of the resolve of the British public and the extraordinary success of our NHS in vaccinating more than 17.5 million people across the UK. The data so far suggests both vaccines are effective against the dominant strains of Covid. Public Health England has found that one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduces hospitalisations and deaths by at least 75 per cent. And early data suggests that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine provides a good level of protection, though since we only started deploying this vaccine last month, at this stage the size of its effect is less certain. But no vaccine can ever be 100 per cent effective, nor will everyone take them up, and like all viruses, Covid-19 will mutate.
So, as the modelling released by SAGE today shows, we cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths. This would happen whenever lockdown is lifted, whether now or in six or nine months, because there will always be some vulnerable people who are not protected by the vaccine. There is therefore no credible route to a Zero Covid Britain or indeed a Zero Covid World and we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental well-being, and the life-chances of our children. And that is why it is so crucial that this roadmap should be cautious but also irreversible. We are setting out on what I hope and believe is a one way road to freedom. And this journey is made possible by the pace of the vaccination programme. In England, everyone in the top four priority groups was successfully offered a vaccine by the middle of February. We now aim to offer a first dose to all those in groups 5 to 9 by 15 April, and I am setting another stretching target: to offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July. As more of us are inoculated, so the protection afforded by the vaccines will gradually replace the restrictions and today’s roadmap sets out the principles of that transition. The level of infection is broadly similar across England, so we will ease restrictions in all areas at the same time. The sequence will be driven by the evidence, so outdoor activity will be prioritised as the best way to restore freedoms while minimising the risk. At every stage, our decisions will be led by data not dates, and subjected to four tests. First, that the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully; second, that evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths; third, that infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS; and fourth, that our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of Covid that cause concern. Before taking each step we will review the data against these tests
and because it takes at least four weeks for the data to reflect the impact of relaxations in restrictions and we want to give the country a week’s notice before each change - there will be at least five weeks between each step. The Chief Medical Officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and re-impose restrictions. I won’t take that risk. Step one will happen from 8 March, by which time those in the top four priority groups will be benefiting from the increased protection they receive from their first dose of their vaccine. Mr Speaker, all the evidence shows that classrooms are the best places for our young people to be. That’s why I’ve always said that schools would be the last to close and the first to reopen. And based on our assessment of the current data against the four tests,
I can tell the House that two weeks’ from today pupils and students in all schools and further education settings can safely return to face-to-face teaching, supported by twice-weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils. Families and childcare bubbles will also be encouraged to get tested regularly. Breakfast and afterschool clubs can also re-open - and other children’s activities, including sport, can restart where necessary to help parents to work. Students on university courses requiring practical teaching, specialist facilities or onsite assessments will also return but all others will need to continue learning online, and we will review the options for when they can return by the end of the Easter Holidays. From 8 March, people will also be able to meet one person from outside their household for outdoor recreation – such as a coffee on a bench or a picnic in a park - in addition to exercise. But we are advising the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable to shield at least until the end of March. Every care home resident will be able to nominate a named visitor, able to see them regularly provided they are tested and wear PPE. And finally we will amend regulations to enable a broader range of Covid-secure campaign activities for local elections on 6 May. As part of Step one, we will go further and make limited changes on 29 March, when schools go on Easter holidays. It will become possible to meet in limited numbers outdoors, where the risk is lower. So the Rule of Six will return outdoors, including in private gardens and outdoor meetings of two households will also be permitted on the same basis, so that families in different circumstances can meet.
Outdoor sports facilities – such as tennis and basketball courts, and open-air swimming pools – will be able to reopen and formally organised outdoor sports will resume, subject to guidance. From this point, 29 March, people will no longer be legally required to stay at home but many lockdown restrictions will remain. People should continue to work from home where they can and minimise all travel wherever possible. Step two will begin at least five weeks after the beginning of step one and no earlier than 12 April, with an announcement at least seven days in advance. If analysis of the latest data against the four tests requires a delay,
then this and subsequent steps will also be delayed to maintain the five week gap. In step two non-essential retail will reopen, as will personal care including hairdressers I’m glad to say, and nail salons. Indoor leisure facilities such as gyms will re-open, as will holiday-lets, but only for use by individuals or household groups. We will begin to re-open our pubs and restaurants outdoors and Hon Members will be relieved there will be no curfew and the Scotch Egg debate will be over because there will be no requirement for alcohol to be accompanied by a substantial meal. Zoos, theme parks and drive-in cinemas will re-open as will public libraries and community centres. Step three will begin no earlier than 17 May. Provided the data satisfies the four tests,
most restrictions on meetings outdoors will be lifted, subject to a limit of thirty. And this is the point when you will be able to see your friends and family indoors - subject to the Rule of Six or the meeting of two households. We will also reopen pubs and restaurants indoors along with cinemas and children’s play areas, hotels, hostels, and B&amp;Bs. Theatres and concert halls will open their doors, and the turnstiles of our sports stadia will once again rotate subject in all cases to capacity limits depending on the size of the venue. And we will pilot larger events using enhanced testing, with the ambition of further easing of restrictions in the next step. Step 4 will begin no earlier than 21 June. With appropriate mitigations, we will aim to remove all legal limits on social contact, and on weddings and other life events. We will re-open everything up to and including nightclubs, and enable large events such as theatre performances above the limits of step 3, potentially using testing to reduce the risk of infection. Mr Speaker, our journey back towards normality will be subject to resolving a number of key questions and to do this we will conduct four reviews. One will assess how long we need to maintain social distancing and face masks. This will also inform guidance on working from home – which should continue wherever possible until this review is complete. And it will be critical in determining how Parliament can safely return in a way that I know Hon Members would wish. A second review will consider the resumption of international travel which is vital for many businesses which have been hardest hit including retail, hospitality, tourism and aviation. A successor to the Global Travel Taskforce will report by 12 April so that people can plan for the summer. The third review will consider the potential role of Covid-status certification in helping venues to open safely but mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy. And the fourth review will look at the safe return of major events. Mr Speaker, as we proceed through these steps we will benefit from the combined protection of our vaccines and the continued expansion of rapid testing. We will extend the provision of free test kits for workplaces until the end of June and families, small businesses and the self-employed can collect those tests from local testing sites. Mr Speaker, in view of these cautious but I hope irreversible changes, people may be concerned about what these changes mean for the various support packages, for livelihoods for people and for the economy. So I want to assure the House, we will not pull the rug out. For the duration of the pandemic, the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. And my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will set out further details in the Budget next Wednesday, Finally, Mr Speaker, we must remain alert to the constant mutations of the virus. Next month we will publish an updated plan for responding to local outbreaks, with a range of measures to address variants of concern, including surge PCR testing and enhanced contact tracing. We can’t, I’m afraid, rule out re-imposing restrictions at local or regional level if evidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a new variant which escapes the vaccines. Mr Speaker, I know there will be many people who will be worried that we are being too ambitious and that it is arrogant to impose any kind of plan upon a virus. And I agree that we must always be humble in the face of nature and we must be cautious but I really also believe that the vaccination programme has dramatically changed the odds in our favour and it is on that basis that we can now proceed. And of course there will be others who will believe that we could go faster on the basis of that vaccination programme and I understand their feelings and I sympathise very much with the exhaustion and the stress that people are experiencing and that businesses are experiencing after so long in lockdown. But to them I say that today the end really is in sight and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today. And in that spirit, I commend this Statement to the House 

Boris:


There is a habit of turning up at occasions such as these and announcing portentously that the West is locked in terminal decline, the Atlantic alliance is fractured, and NATO is in peril, and everything we hold dear risks being cast into oblivion. And that industry of pessimism has thrived recently, perhaps even in Munich. So without wishing for a moment to downplay the challenges and dangers we face, in the teeth of a global pandemic, let me respectfully suggest that the gloom has been overdone and we are turning a corner, and the countries we call the “West” are drawing together and combining their formidable strengths and expertise once again, immensely to everybody’s benefit. As you’ve seen and heard earlier, America is unreservedly back as leader of the free world and that is a fantastic thing. And it’s vital for our American friends to know that their allies on this side of the Atlantic are willing and able to share the risks and the burdens of addressing the world’s toughest problems That is why Global Britain is there and that is exactly what Global Britain is striving to achieve. I’m delighted to report that I detected precisely that willingness among my fellow G7 leaders when I chaired a virtual meeting earlier today. The shared goals of the UK’s presidency of the G7 are to help the world to build back better and build back greener after the pandemic and minimise the risk of a catastrophe like this happening again. We all have lessons to learn from an experience that none of us would want to repeat. At the last UN General Assembly, I proposed a five-point plan to protect the world against future pandemics and today the G7 agreed to explore a Treaty on Pandemic Preparedness, working through the World Health Organization, which would enshrine the actions that countries need to take to safeguard everyone against another Covid. I intend to bring together my fellow leaders, scientists and international organisations for collective defence against the next pathogen, just as we unite against military threats. The heroic endeavours of the world’s scientists produced safe and effective vaccines against Covid in barely 300 days. In future we should aim to telescope that even more: by drawing together our resources, we should seek to develop vaccines against emerging diseases in 100 days. Even in the early weeks of the pandemic, I hope that we in the UK resisted the temptations of a sauve qui peut approach and tried to keep the flame of global cooperation alive. We helped to establish COVAX, the global alliance to bring Covid vaccines to developing countries, and today Britain ranks among COVAX’s biggest donors, with the aim of supplying a billion doses to 92 nations, and we will also share the majority of any surplus from our domestic vaccination programme. When Oxford University and AstraZeneca began their momentous effort against Covid, their express aim was to design a vaccine that would be cheap to obtain and easy to store, so that it could be speedily administered by every country. Protecting ourselves also means tracking the virus’s mutations, and nearly half of all the genome sequencing of possible Covid variants, anywhere in the world, has taken place in the UK. Now we need to mobilise our shared expertise to create an early warning system for the next pathogen, enabled by a worldwide network of pandemic surveillance centres, and the UK intends work alongside the WHO and our friends to bring this about. If anything good can possibly come from this tragedy, we have at least been given the chance to build a global recovery on new and green foundations, so that humanity can prosper without imperilling the planet. To that end,  as you’ve just been hearing from John Kerry, Britain will host COP-26 in Glasgow in November and I’m delighted that America under President Biden’s leadership has rejoined the Paris Agreement. The UK’s aim will be to help to rally as many countries as possible behind the target of Net Zero by 2050. We were the first industrialised nation to adopt this goal and we have made it legally binding and published our plan for a Green Industrial Revolution to show how we will get there, so I hope that other countries will follow the UK’s example. But we can only address global problems alongside our friends, and extend Britain’s influence around the world, if the UK itself and our own citizens are safe, including from the terrorist threat we all face. The starting point of our Integrated Review of foreign, defence and development policy – which will be published next month – is that the success of Global Britain depends on the security of our homeland and the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area. If climate change and pandemics are silent and insidious threats, hostile states may seek to harm our people in direct and obvious ways, as the Russian state did with reckless abandon in Salisbury three years ago, only to collide with the immovable rock of trans-Atlantic solidarity, sanctions and coordinated diplomatic expulsions, an outstanding act of collective security, for which I once again thank our friends. If we are to assure our safety, our democracies need to strengthen their capabilities to meet the rigours of an ever more competitive world. And it is precisely for that reason, so that we can keep our people safe, by fulfilling our obligations to NATO and enhancing the UK’s global influence, that is the reason I have decided to bolster our armed forces with the biggest increase in our defence budget since the Cold War. The UK’s defence spending will rise by £24 billion over the next four years, comfortably exceeding the NATO pledge to invest 2 percent of GDP, and ensuring that we retain the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO, after the United States. We will focus our investment on the new technologies that will revolutionise warfare – artificial intelligence, unmanned aircraft, directed energy weapons and many others – so that we stand alongside our allies to deter any adversary and preserve the peace. This year, the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, will embark on her maiden deployment, sailing 20,000 nautical miles to the Indo-Pacific and back. On her flight deck will be a squadron of F35 jets from the US Marine Corps; among her escorts will be an American destroyer, showing how the British and American armed forces can operate hand-in-glove - or plane-on-flightdeck - anywhere in the world. But investing in new capabilities is not an end in itself. The purpose of the military instrument is to strengthen diplomacy and therefore maximise the chances of success. We do not wish to live in a world of unchecked rivalry or decoupling or obstacles to sensible cooperation and global economic growth. Nor are we concerned solely with trade: I hope the UK has shown by our actions that we will defend our values as well as our interests. In leaving the European Union we restored sovereign control over vital levers of foreign policy. For the first time in nearly 50 years, we now have the power to impose independent national sanctions, allowing the UK to act swiftly and robustly. Our first decision was to create a Magnitsky regime designed to punish human rights offenders. The UK then became the first European country to sanction senior figures in Belarus after the stolen election. We have now imposed sanctions on over 50 human rights violators, including from Russia, Myanmar and Zimbabwe. We have consistently spoken out against China’s repression of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province - and we will continue to do so. We have introduced new measures to ensure that the supply chains of UK companies are not tainted by the violations in Xinjiang. After China broke a treaty and imposed a repressive national security law on Hong Kong, the UK offered nearly 3 million of the territory’s people a route to British citizenship. We acted quickly and willingly – with cross-party support at home – to keep faith with the people of Hong Kong. Now that we have left the EU, Parliament has a greater say over foreign policy and this has only reinforced our national determination to be a Force for Good in the world. Britain is working alongside France, Germany and the United States in a trans-Atlantic quad to address the most pressing security issues, including Iran. And I sense a new resolve among our European friends and allies to come together and act again with unity and determination, and we witnessed that spirit after the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, as he recovered in a hospital bed in Berlin. While NATO was being written-off in some places, the supertanker of European defence spending was quietly beginning to turn, and while this delicate high seas manoeuvre is far from complete, and the vessel needs to alter course a good deal more, the fact is that NATO defence spending – excluding the United States – has risen by $190 billion since the Wales summit in 2014. When our allies on the eastern flank sought reassurance about their security, NATO responded by deploying a multinational force in Poland and the Baltic states and the UK was proud to make the biggest single contribution, leading the battlegroup in Estonia, showing that we mean it when we say that our commitment to European security is unconditional and immoveable. I believe that Europe increasingly recognises the necessity of joining our American friends to rediscover that far-sighted leadership and the spirit of adventure and trans-Atlantic unity, that made our two continents great in the first place. A new world is rising up around us, patterns of trade and commerce are changing, the global centre of gravity is moving eastwards, the technological revolution proceeds with blistering speed. But none of us should fear or resent these changes. Free societies are united by their faith in liberal democracy, the rule of law and free markets, which surely comprise the great trinity of human progress. Free countries – many of them located far beyond the geographical “West”, by the way – possess a boundless and inherent ability to release the talents and enterprise of their people to master and adapt to change. It is no coincidence that of the 10 most innovative nations in the world – as ranked by the Global Innovation Index in 2020 – all but one are liberal democracies. There is no reason why our countries should not be stronger and safer in 2030 – or indeed 2050 – than today, provided we share the burdens, compete successfully and seek out friends and partners wherever they may be found. I have invited South Korea, and Australia and India to attend the next G7 summit as guests, alongside leading international organisations. So let’s resist any temptation to bemoan the changes around us. Let’s build a coalition for openness and innovation, reaching beyond established alliances and the confines of geography, proud of our history, but free of any temptation to turn back the clock, and harnessing the genius of open societies to flourish in an era of renewed competition. Let’s respectfully dispel the air of pessimism that has sometimes attended our conferences. America and Europe, side by side, have the ability to prove once again the innate advantages of free nations, and to succeed in forging our own destiny. 

Boris:


Today the national vaccination programme continues to power past the target we set six weeks ago with more than 15 million people vaccinated across the UK. And once again I pay tribute to the astonishing efforts of everyone involved – the GPs, the nurses, the volunteers, the army and the pharmacists like Hardik Desai - who rallied local volunteers to vaccinate 3,000 people in his village hall in Ticehurst in Sussex, while keeping his pharmacy open - and of course I thank all of you who have come forward to be vaccinated. This is an unprecedented national achievement but it’s no moment to relax and in fact it’s the moment to accelerate because the threat from this virus remains very real. Yes, it’s true, we have vaccinated more than 90 per cent of those aged over 70 but don’t forget that 60 per cent of hospital patients with Covid are under 70. And although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don’t have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the spread of infection. We have some interesting straws in the wind. We have grounds for confidence. But the vaccinations have only been running for a matter of weeks - and while we are learning the whole time - we don’t today have all the hard facts that we need. And the level of infection remains very high, with more people still in hospital today than at the peak last April and admissions running at 1,600 a day. So we have to keep our foot to the floor. And I can tell you today that the next million letters are landing on people’s mats right now, offering appointments to the over-65s and we are also contacting all those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers. And if we can keep this pace up – and if we can keep supply steady – and I hope and believe we can - then we hope to offer a vaccination to everyone in the first nine priority groups – including everyone over 50 – by the end of April. And at the same time we will be giving second doses to millions of the most vulnerable within twelve weeks of the first. So this moment is a huge step forward but it’s only a first step. And while it shows what the country can do we must be both optimistic but also patient. And next week I will be setting out a roadmap saying as much as we possibly can about the route to normality even though some things are very uncertain. Because we want this lockdown to be the last. And we want progress to be cautious but also irreversible. So please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you. 

Boris:


It is five weeks since we set ourselves the target of vaccinating almost 15 million of the most vulnerable people in the country, and the aim was – and is – clear to everyone. By offering the prospect of protection from Covid to everyone 70 and over, to all frontline NHS and care staff, to older care home residents and staff and to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, we can do the most, the fastest, to reduce the incidence of death and serious illness. And, with less than a week to go until the target date of Monday 15th, there is no doubt that we have made great strides, with just over 13 million people now vaccinated in our United Kingdom, including 1 in 4 adults in England, over 90 per cent of everyone over 75 and over 90 per cent of eligible residents of care homes for the elderly. But that still leaves nearly 2 million people – a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham – that we still hope to reach. And there are people across the country who for one reason or another haven’t yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it, wherever you are – you won’t be more than about 10 miles away from a vaccination centre. So, go online, or get someone to help you or simply pick up the phone and call 119. And let me appeal to the fantastic social care workers we all rely on to look after our relatives, our parents and grandparents. If you have not received a letter, please contact your employer and fix it up. And let me stress that these vaccines are safe and effective, and it was good to see the World Health Organisation today confirm its support for the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine for use in everyone over the age of 18 and, obviously, anyone over 65, and also supporting the 12-week interval between the two doses. Indeed, they say the longer interval provides greater protection. And the reason I make this appeal today, for people to come forward in those groups and get vaccinated, is not so we hit some numerical target, but to save lives, prevent serious illness, and so the whole country can take another step on a long and hard road back to normality. And, as the data comes in, I’ll be saying more about that – including setting out the roadmap – over the next two weeks. I think the people of this country absolutely understand the importance of protecting the most vulnerable first and that is what we are doing. And, if we can keep the pace up and keep the supplies of vaccines up, we hope to reach everyone in cohorts 1 to 9 by the end of April. And I want to thank all of those involved for their heroic efforts: the doctors, nurses, military medics, local authorities, transport planners, warehouse operatives, delivery drivers, countless volunteers, often working through the night or even digging out snowed-in vaccination centres, like the community effort at Alwoodley Medical Centre in Leeds last Saturday so GPs, nurses and their teams could deliver 1,200 doses that day. And I want to thank the millions of people who have received their vaccinations and, with cases still high and the pressures on our NHS still severe, I want finally thank everyone, all of you who are continuing to follow the rules and urge you once again to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, When Captain Sir Tom Moore decided to launch a national campaign in his own back garden raising more money and achieving more in his one hundredth year than perhaps any Centenarian in our history he knew instinctively which organisation he wanted to thank and support it was – and is – the NHS. And he was right. Because there are many people and groups responsible for the UK’s vaccination programme and we owe our thanks to our brilliant scientists, to Kate Bingham and the Vaccine Task Force which has procured over 400 million doses of seven different types of vaccine, to the manufacturers and the delivery drivers, the pharmacists, the military medics, countless volunteers, but to get this life-saving medicine into the arms of the nation at the kind of speed that we’re seeing we are relying on the doctors, nurses and all the staff of our NHS. And it is thanks to their effort – the most colossal in the history of our National Health Service - that we have today passed the milestone of 10 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom, including almost 90 per cent of those aged 75 and over in England and every eligible person in a care home. And with every jab and every day, we have more evidence about the effectiveness of these vaccines. New research from Oxford University suggests the protection provided by the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine kicks in after three weeks and lasts right the way through to the booster at three months. And research also shows that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine seems likely to reduce transmission to others. And even if these vaccines cannot make us invulnerable, and no vaccine has ever given 100 per cent protection to everybody the evidence increasingly shows that our vaccines achieve this crucial objective: to reduce death and serious illness from those major strains of Covid that have been subject to research. And in the days leading up to our review point in the week of the 15th of February we will be accumulating even more data helped by NHS Test and Trace – so that we can begin to chart a way ahead starting, if the data allow, with the re-opening of schools on March 8th. And I will be setting out as much as we can about that roadmap forward on February 22nd And though today there are some signs of hope the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high. And I am sorry to say that we have lost another 1,322 lives in the last 24 hours alone and our hearts again go out to every family that grieves. And the wards of our NHS are under huge pressure with more than 32,000 Covid patients still in hospital. And so tonight let’s clap together for Captain Tom at 6pm and let’s clap for the spirit of optimism that he stood for but let’s also clap for all those he campaigned for our brilliant NHS staff and care workers and let’s do everything we can to carry on supporting them. Because if we stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, then in the words of Captain Tom - tomorrow will be a good day. 

Boris:


When we look at the toll of this pandemic it must be measured not only in the tragic loss of life that we have endured with over 100,000 deaths and once again I offer my condolences to the families and friends of everybody who has lost loved ones - but I’m afraid we must also remember not just the damage to the economy, but the lost weeks and months of education and the real risk of damage to the prospects of our young people. And so I share very much the frustration of pupils and teachers who today want nothing more than to get back to the classroom. And I understand the stress and the anxieties of parents coping heroically with the pressures of homeschooling. And I know that everybody across the country wants us to get schools open as fast as possible And I can assure you that is the ambition of this Government. But I also know, we all know, that with 37,000 people in hospital suffering from covid and the infection rates still forbiddingly high you, we all, must be cautious and we all want only to open schools when we can be sure that this will not cause another huge surge in the disease. Because the problem is not that schools are unsafe teachers and headteachers have worked heroically to make sure that they are safe, that they are covid secure The problem is that by definition, schools bring many households together And that contributes to the spread of the virus within the community, and drives up the R. And so it follows that if we are to get schools open – and keep them open – which is what we all want then we need to be clear about certain things. We need to be sure the vaccine roll-out is continuing to be successful as it is and most important, we need to see the impact of our vaccines on those graphs of mortality, we need to see that they really are saving lives and preventing people from becoming seriously ill. Now we are confident that will happen and vaccines will have that effect but to be responsible we must see the proof. And our current estimates say that the proof will only become visible in the middle of February. And since we need to give schools two weeks’ notice to re-open it is sensible now to serve notice that we will not be able to re-open schools immediately after half-term on 22nd February. But if we continue to make the progress that we want to see, and that we believe we can see, Then we hope to begin opening schools on Monday 8th March. And to help parents and teachers with this extended period of remote learning We will extend the arrangements for providing free school meals for those eligible children not in school including food parcels and the national voucher scheme – until those pupils have returned to the classroom. And as we did this financial year, we will provide a catch-up programme over the next financial year, with a further £300 million of new money to schools for tutoring, and we will work with the education sector to develop, wherever appropriate, specific initiatives for summer schools as well as a Covid Premium for catch-up and to support pupils to catch up We will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament, so we tackle that issue of differential learning and kids who may have fallen behind through no fault of their own And so with every jab that goes in we are becoming more confident that we will reach our target of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And at that moment we will be able to review our progress, judge the state of the pandemic, and the effectiveness of the vaccine, and then in the week beginning 22nd February we will set out our plan not just for re-opening our schools but gradually to re-open our economy and our society and to get our lives back to as close to normal as possible. Now this will be a timetable that is inevitably going to be subject to adjustment But I believe it will provide clarity and certainty about the way ahead, a roadmap that we can take together and use as a country to defeat the virus and begin steadily to reclaim our lives. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement on the Government’s measures to safeguard our United Kingdom against the new variants of Covid until we have administered enough vaccinations to free ourselves from the virus. And I am acutely conscious that at this moment, parents are balancing the demands of working from home with supporting the education of their children, businesspeople are enduring the sight of their shops or restaurants or other enterprises standing empty and idle and, sadly, too many are coping with the anxiety of illness or tragedy of bereavement. I am deeply sorry to say that the number of people that have taken from us has surpassed 100,000, as the house was discussing only an hour or so ago, and I know the House will join me in offering condolences to all those who have lost loved ones. The most important thing we can do to honour their memory is to persevere against this virus with ever greater resolve, and that is why we have launched the biggest vaccination programme in British history. Three weeks ago, I reported that the UK had immunised 1.3 million people; now that figure has multiplied more than fivefold to exceed 6.8 million people, more than any other country in Europe and over 13 per cent of the entire adult population. In England we have now delivered first doses to over four-fifths of those aged 80 or over, and over half of those aged between 75 and 79 and three quarters of elderly care home residents And though it remains an exacting target, we are on track to achieve our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. I can also reassure the House that all current evidence shows that both the vaccines we are administering remain effective against the new variant that was first identified in London and the South East by means of our world-leading capability in genomic sequencing. The UK has now sequenced over half of all COVID-19 viral genomes that have been submitted to the global database, 10 times more than any other country. And yesterday, my Rt Hon Friend the Health Secretary announced our New Variant Assessment Platform, through which we will work with the World Health Organisation to offer our expertise to help other countries, because a new variant anywhere poses a potential threat everywhere. To guard against this danger, we must also take additional steps to strengthen our borders to stop those strains from entering the UK. We have already temporarily closed all travel corridors and we are already requiring anyone coming to this country to have proof of a negative Covid test taken in the 72 hours before leaving. They must also complete a Passenger Locator Form which must be checked before they board - and then quarantine on arrival for ten days. I want to make clear that under the stay at home regulations it is illegal to leave home to travel abroad for leisure purposes and we will enforce this at ports and airports by asking people why they are leaving and instructing them to return home if they do not have a valid reason to travel. We have also banned all travel from 22 countries where there is a risk of known variants including South Africa, Portugal and South American nations, and in order to reduce the risk posed by UK nationals and residents returning home from these countries,I can announce that we will require all such arrivals who cannot be refused entry to isolate in government-provided accommodation - such as hotels - for ten days without exception.
They will be met at the airport and transported directly into quarantine. The Department for Health and Social Care is working to establish these facilities as quickly as possible and my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary will set out the details of our plans in her statement shortly. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has this morning spoken to the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and the First and deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland and, as we have throughout the pandemic, we will be working closely with the DAs to implement these new measures so that, where possible, we continue to take a UK-wide approach. Mr Speaker, it was the emergence of a new variant – up to 70 per cent more transmissible –  that forced England back into lockdown, and I know everyone yearns to know how much longer we must endure these restrictions, with all their consequences for jobs, livelihoods and most tragically of all, the life chances of our children. We will not persist for a day longer than is necessary, but nor can we relax too soon, because if we do we run the risk of our NHS coming under still greater pressure, compelling us to re-impose every restriction and sustain those restrictions for longer. So far, our efforts do appear to have reduced the R rate, but we do not yet have enough data to know exactly how soon it will be safe to reopen our society and economy. At this point, we do not have enough data to judge the full effect of vaccines in blocking transmission nor the extent and speed with which the vaccines will reduce hospitalisations and deaths, nor how quickly the combination of vaccinations and the lockdown can be expected to ease the pressure on the NHS. What we do know is that we remain in a perilous situation, with more than 37,000 patients now in hospital with Covid, almost double the peak of the first wave. But the overall picture should be clearer by mid-February: by then, we will know much more about the effect of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and deaths, using data from the UK but also other nations like Israel.
We will know how successful the current restrictions have been in driving down infections. We will also know how many people are still in hospital with Covid, which we simply can’t predict with certainty today. So we will then be in a better position to chart a course out of lockdown, without risking a further surge that would overwhelm the NHS. When I announced the lockdown I said we would review its measures in mid-February, once the most vulnerable had been offered the first dose of the vaccine. So I can tell the House that when Parliament returns from Recess in the week commencing 22nd February subject to the full agreement of the House, Mr Speaker, we intend to set out the results of that review and publish our plan for taking the country out of lockdown. That plan will, of course, depend on the continued success of our vaccination programme, the capacity of the NHS, and on deaths falling at the pace we would expect as more people are inoculated. Our aim will be to set out a gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way, guided by the principles we have observed throughout the pandemic, beginning with the most important principle of all: that re-opening schools must be our national priority and the first sign of normality beginning to return should be pupils going back to their classrooms. I know how parents and teachers need as much certainty as possible, including two weeks’ notice of the return of face-to-face teaching. So I must inform the House that, for the reasons I have outlined, it will not be possible to re-open schools immediately after the February half term. I know how frustrating that will be for pupils and teachers who want nothing more than to get back in the classroom and for parents and carers who have spent so many months juggling their day jobs not only with home schooling but with meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime.
And I know too the worries we all share about the mental health of our young people during this prolonged period of being stuck at home. So our plan for leaving the lockdown will set out our approach towards re-opening schools. If we achieve our target of vaccinating everyone in the four most vulnerable groups with their first dose by 15 February – and every passing day sees more progress towards that goal – then those groups will have developed immunity from the virus by about three weeks later, that is by 8 March. We hope it will therefore be safe to commence the reopening of schools from Monday 8 March, with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as and when the data permits – then or thereafter, I should say, Mr Speaker. As we are extending the period of remote learning beyond the middle of February, I can confirm that the government will prolong arrangements for providing free school meals for those eligible children not in school – including food parcels and the national voucher scheme – until they have returned to the classroom.
We can also commit now that, as we did this financial year, we will provide a programme of catch up over the next financial year. This will involve a further £300m of new money to schools for tutoring and we will work in collaboration with the education sector to develop, as appropriate, specific initiatives for summer schools and a Covid Premium to support catch up. But we recognise that these extended school closures have had a huge impact on children’s learning which will take more than a year to make up. So we will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament. I know, Mr Speaker, that the measures I am setting out today will be deeply frustrating to many honourable friends and colleagues, and disappointing for all of us. But the way forward has been clear ever since the vaccines arrived and, as we inoculate more people hour by hour, this is the time to hold our nerve in the endgame of the battle against the virus. Our goal now must be to buy the extra weeks we need to immunise the most vulnerable and get this virus under control, so that together we can defeat this most wretched disease, reclaim our lives once and for all, and, Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


I am sorry to have to tell you that today the number of deaths recorded from Covid in the UK has surpassed 100,000, and it is hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic. The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye. I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one: fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken. And, to all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others. We will remember the courage of countless working people – not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others – who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War. We will commemorate the small acts of kindness, the spirit of volunteering and the daily sacrifice of millions who placed their lives on hold time and again as we fought each new wave of the virus, buying time for our brilliant scientists to come to our aid. In that moment of commemoration, we will celebrate the genius and perseverance of those who discovered the vaccines and the immense national effort – never seen before in our history – which is now underway to distribute them, one that has now seen us immunise over 6.8 million people across the United Kingdom. And when those vaccines have finally freed us from this virus and put us on a path to recovery, we will make sure that we learn the lessons and reflect and prepare. And, until that time, the best and most important thing we can all do to honour the memory of those who have died is to work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease. And that is what we will do. 

Boris:


Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have tried to update you as soon as possible about changes in the scientific data or the analysis. So, I must tell you this afternoon that we have been informed today that, in addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant – the variant that was first identified in London and the South East – may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, and I’m going to ask Patrick in a minute to say a bit more about that. Because it is largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure, with another 40,261 positive cases since yesterday. We have 38,562 COVID patients now in hospital, that’s 78 per cent higher than the first peak in April and, tragically, there have been a further 1,401 deaths. So, it is more important than ever that we all remain vigilant in following the rules and that we stay at home, protect the NHS and thereby save lives. But I also want to answer a key question that I know will be uppermost in your minds. All current evidence continues to show that both the vaccines we are currently using remain effective both against the old variant and this new variant. And so, you will also want to know that our immunisation programme continues at an unprecedented rate. 5.4 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of the vaccine and over the last 24 hours we can report a record 400,000 vaccinations. In England one in ten of all adults have received their first dose, including 71 per cent of over-80s and two thirds of elderly care home residents. Having secured orders for hundreds of millions of doses, the U.K. government has supplied vaccines to the Devolved Administrations, according to population size. First doses have been administered now to 151,000 people in Northern Ireland, 358,000 in Scotland and 212,000 in Wales. And I am glad that the whole of the U.K. is able to assist the Devolved Administrations in deploying the vaccine and I know everyone across the country is grateful for the logistical skill of the British Army. There is much more to do, and the target remains very stretching indeed, but we remain on track to reach our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And I want to thank all the doctors and nurses, especially at the GP-led sites who are vaccinating at a phenomenal rate, as well as, as I say, all those in our armed forces, our local authorities, our pharmacies and volunteers, who are making this extraordinary national effort possible. And I want to thank all of you who have come forward to get your jabs, because, by doing that, you are protecting yourselves, your communities and, of course, our NHS. And I say to everyone, when that letter arrives, please don’t hesitate to book that appointment and get this life-saving protection, because this is the best and fastest way for us all to defeat this virus and get our lives back to normal. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021 Good afternoon. As you know, this country is engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in our history, and the chances are that you know someone personally who has already received a vaccine. But it would be fatal if this sense of progress were now to breed any kind of complacency because the pressures on our NHS are extraordinary. On Tuesday we saw 4,134 new admissions to hospital on a single day, the highest at any point in this pandemic. There are now more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospital across the UK and, in spite of all the efforts of our doctors and nurses and our medical staff, we are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards. And with 55,761 positive cases since yesterday and, very sadly, 1,280 deaths, this is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts. So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives. And please remember that this disease can be passed on not just by standing too near someone in a supermarket queue, but also by handling something touched by an infected person. And remember also that 1 in 3 people with Covid have no symptoms, and that is why that original message of hands, face and space, washing your hands, is as important now as it has ever been. And it is precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country. So, yesterday we announced that we are banning flights from South America and Portugal. And, to protect us against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains, we will also temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday. Following conversations with the devolved administrations, we will act together so that this applies across the whole of UK This means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you have taken in the 72 hours before leaving and you must have filled in your Passenger Locator Form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off. You may also be checked when you land and face substantial fines for refusing to comply And, upon arrival, you must then quarantine for ten days – not leaving your home for any reason at all, or take another test on day 5 and wait for proof of another negative result. And we will be stepping up our enforcement – both at the border and in-country. And it is vital to take these extra measures now when day by day, hour by hour, we are making such strides in protecting the population. We have now vaccinated over 3.2 million people across the UK, doubling the numbers of last week. That’s 2.8 million in England, 225,000 in Scotland, 126,000 in Wales and 115,000 in Northern Ireland. Yesterday alone, we vaccinated around a quarter of a million people in England, and that is still far more than any other country in Europe. And with almost 45 per cent of our over 80s now vaccinated and almost 40 per cent of care home residents, we are steadily protecting those most at risk. And I pay particular tribute to the vaccination efforts going on in Cockermouth, in Cumbria, Yateley and Cheltenham, where they have vaccinated around 90 per cent of their over-80s in their communities. And I’ll also pay tribute to North Lincolnshire, to Sunderland and Morecambe Bay, where vaccination teams have protected over 80 per cent of their care home residents. And it’s thanks to that amazing constellation of the vaccination teams: doctors and nurses armed forces, local authorities, pharmacies and volunteers that we are steadily building up that immunity, that protection for the vulnerable, for the NHS and for us all. So, when the call comes, please do get a jab and, in the meantime, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. 

Boris:


Christine thank you very much, I want to thank you and I want to thank Emmanuel for organising this One Planet Summit, because I think it’s an absolutely crucial subject. After all, we’re making a lot of progress as humanity in finding the technological solutions to tackle climate change and reduce carbon. Clearly there’s a huge amount still to do but we’re starting to see a way forward since the Paris Summit five years ago which was I think a huge success, we can see that humanity can do this. But the problem is that we are destroying species and habitat at an absolutely unconscionable rate. I think we’ve lost about 500 species in the last century, of all the mammals in the world – the biomass of mammals – I think I’m right in saying that 96% of mammals on our planet are now human beings or oxen or pigs or the livestock that human beings rely on. 70% of all the birds in the world are chickens. In other words, there has been a total or near-total destruction of wildlife. Only 4% of the mammals in the world are now wild mammals, from whales to monkeys, to you name it. That in my view is a disaster. We’re seeing a parallel loss of habitat, of forests and plant species of all kinds. So that’s why the UK is pledged to protect 30% of our land surface, 30% of our marine surface, to create marine protected areas – vast protected areas – which is something by the way an objective that we share very much with France, with Canada – we’re all engaged in this same effort. And of the £11.6 billion that we’ve consecrated to climate finance initiatives, we’re putting £3 billion to protecting nature, whether it’s marine life, or timber conservation or sustainable food production. I think that as global leaders, we must go further and I’m very pleased therefore that so many countries have signed up to the UN Leaders Pledge for Nature so that we have really hard-edged targets for the preservation of species and wildlife, but also the re-wilding of our planet in the way that Sir David Attenborough has suggested. And I would like to see a world in which we give real meaning to those Aichi targets that were set so many years ago at Kyoto and I hope that our Chinese colleagues will be pushing that agenda at their Biodiversity Summit in Kunming. I know that we will be working with colleagues under the auspices of the UN to do that at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Obviously it’s right to focus on climate change, obviously it’s right to cut CO2 emissions, but we won’t achieve a real balance with our planet unless we protect nature as well. One final thought, don’t forget that the coronavirus pandemic was the product of an imbalance in man’s relationship with the natural world. Like the original plague which struck the Greeks I seem to remember in book one of the Iliad, it is a zoonotic disease. It originates from bats or pangolins, from the demented belief that if you grind up the scales of a pangolin you will somehow become more potent or whatever it is people believe, it originates from this collision between mankind and the natural world and we’ve got to stop it. And that’s why I think that this summit is so important and this focus on the natural world and on biodiversity is absolutely critical. Yes we must tackle climate change, but climate change must be seen as part of an overall agenda to protect the natural world and I think the One Planet agenda is completely right. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021 Good afternoon, today I’m joined by Sir Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England and Brigadier Phil Prosser, who is Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme across our United Kingdom. Because I know there is now one question at the very top of your minds and that is how fast and how effectively we can get these millions of new vaccines into the arms of the most vulnerable and those who need them most. And you want to know that we in government, the NHS, the Armed Forces, local and regional government, government at every level are truly throwing everything at it round the clock if necessary. And I believe that with the country once again in lockdown and all the difficulties that means for you, for your family, for students, for education, for your businesses, and of course with the tragic number of deaths that we’re seeing and that we’ve seen today, you have a right to understand exactly how we are cracking this problem and how the national vaccine effort is progressing. And you rightly want to know how we are going to reach the target that I set out earlier this week of offering a slot for vaccination by 15th of February for everyone in those key groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation That’s over 12 million people in England, and 15 million in the UK including older care home residents and staff everyone 70 or over all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And just to remind you of the importance of these groups for fighting the disease they account for 88 per cent of all those who have sadly lost their lives. And so our tactics are first to use the immense natural capacity of the NHS and by the end of next week there will be over 1,000 GP-led sites providing vaccines 223 hospital sites seven giant vaccination centres and a first wave of 200 community pharmacies If all goes well these together should have the capacity to deliver hundreds of thousands of vaccines per day by Jan 15th and it is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of ten miles. And it follows from that that the limits will not be on our distributional power but on the supply of vaccines. And I have no doubt that we have enough supply to vaccinate these four groups by the Feb 15th deadline and we also have the distributional network to do it and to continue an expanding programme down that priority list. Yes, let’s be clear this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we have seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. And, of course there will be difficulties appointments will be changed but as Brigadier Prosser will shortly explain the army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace. We will publish our full vaccine deployment plan on Monday along with daily updates on the progress we are making. We have now vaccinated 1.26 million people in England, 113,000 in Scotland, 49,000 in Wales, and 46,000 in Northern Ireland. So altogether, nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now received their first dose and within 2-3 weeks all of them will have a very considerable degree of immunity. And it is thanks to the arrival of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which can be stored at room temperature, that we can accelerate the pace of vaccination in care homes. We are using that vaccine in care homes for the first time today and by the end of the month we hope to have offered every elderly care home resident a vaccine. Our new National Booking Service will also make it easier to book and access appointments So I urge everyone to comes forwards because it’s absolutely vital that we should have confidence in these vaccines. And I want to thank everyone involved in this extraordinary national effort all the GPs, nurses, pharmacists and all the staff behind the scenes our armed forces local councils our scientists who have not only developed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the first ever life-saving treatment of Covid in the form of dexamethasone – but I am pleased to tell you today, British scientific research has now contributed to the creation of more new lifesaving treatments that have just passed rigorous clinical trials. In particular, Tocilizumab, sorry I’ll say it again, Tocilizumab and Sarilumab, they’ll shortly be on everybody’s lips which have been found to reduce the risk of death for critically ill patients by almost a quarter and they’ve cut time spent in intensive care by as much as ten days and these lifesaving drugs will be available through the NHS with immediate effect, potentially saving thousands of lives. And finally again I want to thank you – the British public – for coming forward to be vaccinated in the numbers that you have - still greater than all the countries of Europe put together. And yes of course, we are in a race against time but I can assure you we’re doing everything we can to vaccinate as many people as possible across our whole United Kingdom. And in the meantime please stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. And now I’ll hand over to Sir Simon Stevens 

Boris:


Thank you very much Mr Speaker and can I share your gratitude to the House of Commons staff for all their efforts, their hard work to allow us to meet today in the way that we are. And before I begin my statement, I know the thoughts of the whole House are with the Hon Member for Cardiff Central who is currently in hospital with Covid, and we wish her a full and speedy recovery. With permission, I shall make a statement about the measures we are taking to defeat this new variant of Covid-19, protecting our NHS whilst it carries out the vaccinations that will finally free us from this wretched virus. And Mr Speaker, there is a fundamental difference between the regulations before the House today, and the position we have faced at any previous stage, because now we have the vaccines that are the means of our escape and we will use every available second of the lockdown to place this invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable. Already – with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – we have immunised over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million in the UK. Our NHS is following the plan drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which is aimed at saving the most lives in the fastest possible time. And given that the average age of Covid fatalities is over 80, it is significant that we have already vaccinated more than 650,000 people in this age group, meaning that within 2 to 3 weeks, almost 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will all have a significant degree of immunity. By February 15th the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff everyone over 70 all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And in working towards that target there are already almost 1,000 vaccination centres across the country including 595 GP-led sites with a further 180 opening later this week and 107 hospital sites – with another 100 later this week Next week we will also have seven vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. Pharmacies are already working with GPs to deliver the vaccine in many areas of the country and I am grateful to Brigadier Prosser who is leading the efforts of our armed forces in supporting this vaccine rollout. We have already vaccinated more people in this country than in the rest of Europe combined and we will give the House the maximum possible transparency about our acceleration of this effort publishing daily updates online from Monday so that jab by jab Hon Members can scrutinise the progress being made every single day. Yet as we take this giant leap towards finally overcoming this virus and reclaiming our lives, we have to contend with the new variant which is between 50 and 70 per cent more contagious. The old variant, which the House agreed last month, the tiers agreed by this House last month was working with the old variant. But, alas, this mutation spreading with frightening ease and speed in spite of the sterling work of the British public – has led to more cases than we have ever seen before, alas numbers that cannot be explained away by the meteoric rise in testing. When the Office for National Statistics reports that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April, it is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. And so we now have no choice but to return to a national lockdown in England with similar measures being adopted by the Devolved Administrations – so we can control this new variant until we can take the most likely victims out of its path with vaccines. My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Health will open the debate on the full regulations shortly, but the key point I am afraid is that we are once again instructing everyone to stay at home, everyone to stay at home leaving only for limited reasons permitted by law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if people absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape injury or harm, including domestic abuse. We are advising the clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. And because we must do everything possible to stop the spread of the disease we have asked schools and colleges to close their doors to all except vulnerable children and those of critical workers. Mr Speaker, I don’t think the House will be in any doubt about our determination, my determination to keep schools open, especially primary schools – open for as long as possible. Because all the evidence shows that school is the best place for our children. And indeed all the evidence shows that schools are safe, and that the risk posed to children by Coronavirus is vanishingly small. For most children the most dangerous part of going to school, even in the midst of this global pandemic, remains I’m afraid crossing the road in order to get there. But the data showed, and our scientific advisers agreed, that our efforts to contain the spread of this new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential  vector for spreading the virus between households. Mr Speaker, I know the whole House will join me in paying tribute to all the teachers, all the pupils and parents who are now making the rapid move to remote learning, and we will do everything possible to support that process, building on the 560,000 laptops and tablets provided last year with over 50,000 delivered to schools on Monday and more than 100,000 being delivered in total during the first week of term. We have partnered with some of the UK’s leading mobile operators to provide free mobile data to disadvantaged families to support access to education resources. And I am very grateful to EE, Three, Tesco Mobile, Smarty, Sky Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Vodafone for supporting this offer. Oak National Academy will continue to provide video lessons and it’s very good news that the BBC is launching the biggest education programme in its history, with both primary and secondary school programmes across its platforms. We recognise it will not be possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this Summer as normal. And the Education Secretary will be making a statement shortly. Mr Speaker, I know many people will ask whether the decision on schools could have been reached sooner, and the answer is that we have been doing everything in our power to keep them open because children’s education is too vital, and their futures too precious, to be disrupted until every other avenue, every other option had been closed off and every other course of action had been taken. That is why schools were the very last thing to close, as I have long promised they would be. And when we begin to move out of lockdown I promise they will be the very first things to reopen. That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead. And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. That is why the legislation this House will vote on later today runs until 31 March. Not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis carefully brick-by-brick as it were breaking free of our confinement but without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us. The restrictions will be kept under continuous review, with a statutory requirement to review every two weeks and a legal obligation to remove them if they are no longer deemed necessary to limit the transmission of the virus. And for as long as restrictions are in place we will continue to support everyone affected by them from the continued provision of free school meals to the £4.6 billion of additional assistance for our retail, hospitality and leisure sectors announced by my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor yesterday. Mr Speaker, we are in a tough final stretch made only tougher by the new variant – but this country will come together and the miracle of scientific endeavour, much of it right here in the UK, has given us not only the sight of the finish line but a clear route to get there. After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in every arm makes a difference, As I say we are already vaccinating faster than any comparable country and that rate I hope will only increase. But if we’re going to win this race for our population we have to give our army of vaccinators the biggest head start we possibly can. And that is why to do that we must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. And I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021 Good afternoon, I want to update everybody about vaccines because across this entire country today there are people – everybody - making another huge sacrifice. Teachers and pupils coping with online learning Businesses who have borne the brunt of successive lockdowns and, of course, the amazing staff of our NHS and our care workers who are grappling with a new variant - this new variant - of coronavirus. And I believe that when everybody looks at the position people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice when the Office of National Statistics is telling us that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected 
that’s over 1 million people in England –

and when today we have reported another 60,000 new cases and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than at the first peak in April. I think obviously – everybody, you all - want to be sure that we in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end. And I can tell you that this afternoon 
with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – as of this afternoon

we have now vaccinated over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million across the UK. And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80 
which is 23 per cent of all the over 80s in England -

And that means that nearly 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in 2 to 3 weeks – all of them - a significant degree of immunity. And when you consider that the average age of Covid fatalities is in the 80s You can see the importance of what we have already achieved. And that is why I believe that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation was right to draw up a programme aimed at saving the most lives the fastest. So by February 15th, as I said last night, the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff, everyone over 70, all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And to help us with meeting this target we already have 595 GP-led sites providing vaccines, with a further 180 coming on stream later this week. We have 107 hospital sites – with a further 100 later this week So that is almost a thousand sites – vaccination sites - across the country by the end of this week And next week we will also have 7 vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. We know that there will still be long weeks ahead in which we must persevere with these restrictions but I want to give you – the British people – the maximum possible transparency about this vaccine roll out with more detail on Thursday and daily updates from Monday so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making. Thanks very much I am now going to hand over to Chris to do the slides. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s address to the nation: 4 January 2021 Since the pandemic began last year, the whole United Kingdom has been engaged in a great national effort to fight Covid. And there is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working and would have continued to work. But we now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible – that means you are much, much more likely to catch the virus and to pass it on. As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000. That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April. On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones. With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home. You may only leave home for limited reasons permitted in law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if you absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape domestic abuse. The full details on what you can and can’t do will be available at gov.uk/coronavirus. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you. And because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries. We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. We will provide extra support to ensure that pupils entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them while schools are closed, and we’ll distribute more devices to support remote education. I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this late change will cause millions of parents and pupils up and down the country. Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner. The answer is simply that we have been doing everything in our power to keep schools open, because we know how important each day in education is to children’s life chances. And I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe for children – children are still very unlikely to be severely affected by even the new variant of Covid. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households. Today the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officers have advised that the country should move to alert level 5, meaning that if action is not taken NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days. Of course, there is one huge difference compared to last year. We are now rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in our history. So far, we in the UK have vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe combined. With the arrival today of the UK’s own Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine, the pace of vaccination is accelerating. I can share with you tonight the NHS’s realistic expectations for the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. By the middle of February, if things go well and with a fair wind in our sails, we expect to have offered the first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. That means vaccinating all residents in a care home for older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus. And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long. I must stress that even if we achieve this goal, there remains a time lag of two to three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity. And there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. So we should remain cautious about the timetable ahead. But if our understanding of the virus doesn’t change dramatically once again… If the rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful… If deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect… And, critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules… Then I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers. I want to say to everyone right across the United Kingdom that I know how tough this is, I know how frustrated you are, I know that you have had more than enough of government guidance about defeating this virus. But now more than ever, we must pull together. You should follow the new rules from now, and they will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Parliament will meet – largely remotely – later that day. I know that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland share my conviction this is a pivotal moment and they’re taking similar steps. The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we are entering the last phase of the struggle. Because with every jab that goes into our arms, we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people. And, thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight and we know exactly how we will get there. But for now, I am afraid, you must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020 Today I want to begin with the good news: the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which is a fantastic achievement for British science And which will allow us to vaccinate more people, and also vaccinate them more quickly. And there is one important development that’s helping us to accelerate our vaccination programme across the whole of the UK: We’ve had new advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that the first dose can protect people against the worst effects of this virus because the benefits kick in after two or three weeks. And so from now on we will give a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible, with the second dose to follow twelve weeks later. And what that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks. I know everyone watching this will want to know when you can get your vaccine and all I want to say is we are working as hard and as fast as we can to get the supplies to you, and as soon as we have the supplies we will be getting them into people’s arms To summarise where we are We have to face the fact we’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid - One is working for us; and one working against us. On the plus side we have two valid vaccines and we are racing, as I say, to get them out. On the downside, there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country. And we have seen a 40 per cent increase in cases in England in the last week alone, almost 15 per cent more patients in hospital – more than at the peak of the first wave. And yesterday sadly we recorded almost a thousand deaths across the UK, for the first time since April. So at this critical moment with the prospect of freedom within reach We’ve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus. That’s why the Health Secretary has announced that more areas of England will be moving into Tier 4 from tomorrow And as I say again, no-one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do. But we must take firm action now and that’s why we have to think very hard about schools. Because today of course it remains the case that keeping children in education is a national priority it remains the case that schools are safe. But we must face the reality that the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas and that does affect schools Let me set out for you what this means. In most of England, primary schools will still reassemble next week, as planned for the new term. But, in the areas we have just published today on gov.uk, I am afraid the start of the new term will be delayed until at least January 18, when the latest data on those infection rates will be reviewed. That is because the rate of transmission in these areas is so high, and there’s just such pressure on the local NHS, that extra action is required to control the spread of the virus. The children of key workers, or those who are considered to be vulnerable, will still go back to primary schools from next week – wherever they live in England. They are not affected by today’s announcement. In secondary schools, all vulnerable children and the children of critical workers will go back next week across England, as originally planned. But we will ask exam year pupils in secondary schools to learn remotely during the first week of term and return to the classroom from 11 January. The remaining secondary school pupils, i.e. non exam groups will go back a week later, that is from 18 January – but I want to stress that depending on the spread of the disease it may be necessary to take further action in their cases as well, in as I say the worst affected areas. To minimise disruption in schools and to fight the disease we are massively expanding our testing operation ensuring that every secondary school pupil is tested as they return, and regularly thereafter. Again I want to thank the teachers, pupils and parents who have worked so hard to keep schools safe and keep them open. We are also asking universities to reduce the number of students who return to campus in January, prioritising medical courses and others requiring face to face teaching. And in all cases, students should be offered two rapid tests when they return. All of these measures are in the end designed to save lives and to protect the NHS. And for that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the New Year safely at home. That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind. We are still in the tunnel of this pandemic the light however is not merely visible: thanks to an extraordinary feat of British engineering if you like the tunnel has been shortened and we are moving faster through it, and that gives me great confidence about the future in the Spring So for now let’s double our efforts, let’s follow the rules, protect our NHS and together make 2021 the year we leave this tunnel behind us. 

Boris:


Thank you Mr Speaker, can I begin by thanking you and the House authorities and all your staff and their hard work in allowing us to meet today, and can I also welcome the outstanding news that AstraZeneca is now rolling out a new UK made vaccine approved by the MHRA that offers the hope to millions in this country and around the world, Mr Speaker I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time, and having taken back control of our money, our borders, our laws and our waters by leaving the European Union on Jan 31st, we now seize the moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbours, based on free trade and friendly co-operation. And at the heart of this Bill is one of the biggest free trade agreements in the world, a comprehensive Canada-style deal, worth over £660 billion, which, if anything, should allow our companies to do even more business with our European friends, safeguarding millions of jobs and livelihoods in our UK and across the continent. In less than 48 hours, we will leave the EU single market and the customs union, as we promised and yet British exporters will not face a sudden thicket of trade barriers, but rather, for the first time in the history of EU agreements, zero tariffs and zero quotas. And just as we have avoided trade barriers, so we have also ensured the UK’s full control of our laws and our regulations and there is a vital symmetry between those two achievements, because the central purpose of this Bill is to accomplish something that the British people always knew in their hearts could be done, but which we were continually told was impossible, we were told we could not have our cake and eat it, do you remember how often we were told that Mr Speaker, namely that we could trade and cooperate with our European neighbours on the closest terms of friendship and goodwill, whilst retaining sovereign control of our laws and our national destiny. And that unifying thread runs through every clause of this Bill, it embodies our vision – shared with our European neighbours – of a new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values,  while respecting one another’s freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently and we have much to gain from the healthy stimulus of competition. And this Bill demonstrates therefore how Britain can be at once European and sovereign. And I think you’ll agree Mr Speaker our negotiators accomplished their feat with astonishing speed. It took nearly 8 years for the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to produce a deal, and five years for the EU to reach a trade agreement with Canada, six for Japan. We have done this in less than a year, in the teeth of a pandemic, and we have pressed ahead with this task, resisting all the calls for delay, Mr Speaker precisely because creating certainty about our future provides the best chance of beating Covid and bouncing back even more strongly next year. And that was our objective. So I hope the House will join me in commending my Noble Friend Lord Frost and every member of his team for their skill, their mastery and their perseverance in translating our vision into a practical agreement. And let me also pay tribute to President Ursula von der Leyen, Michel Barnier and all our European friends for their pragmatism and foresight and for their understanding that it is profoundly in the interests of the EU to live alongside a prosperous, contented and sovereign United Kingdom. The House understands the significance of the fact that the basis of this agreement is not EU law but international law, so there is no direct effect, the EU law will no longer have any special status in the UK and there is no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice. We will be able to design our own standards and regulations, And Mr Speaker the laws that this House of Commons passes will be interpreted – and I know this is of keen interest to honourable and right honourable members - solely by British judges sitting in British courts. We will have opportunity to devise new ways to spur and encourage the flourishing sectors in which this country leads the world, from green energy and life sciences to synthetic biology. We will be free Mr Speaker of EU state aid rules, We’ll be able to decide where and how we level up across our country with new jobs and new hope, including with freeports and new green industrial zones of a kind I’m sure he’d approve of. And if, in using our new freedoms, either Britain or the EU believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut, then subject to independent third party arbitration - and provided the measures are proportionate - either of us can decide, as sovereign equals, to protect our consumers. But this treaty explicitly envisages that any such action should be infrequent and it banishes the old concepts of uniformity and harmonisation in favour of the right to make our own regulatory choices and deal with the consequences. And Mr Speaker, every modern free trade agreement includes reciprocal commitments designed to prevent distortions of trade and the true significance of the agreement embodied in this Bill is that there is no role for the European Court of Justice, no ratchet clause on labour or environmental standards and no dynamic alignment with the EU State Aid regime - or indeed any other aspect of EU law. In every respect, we have recovered our freedom of action. We will be free of the strictures of the Common Agricultural Policy, We’ll be able to conserve our landscapes and support our farmers exactly as we choose. And on Friday – for the first time 50 years – on Friday the UK will once again be recognised as an independent coastal state, regaining control of our waters, righting the wrong that was done by the Common Fisheries Policy throughout our EU Membership. And of course, I’ve always recognised Mr Speaker that this was going to be a difficult period for our European friends and partners, because they’ve been fishing in these waters for decades if not centuries and at first - as the House will know - they sought an adjustment period of 14 years, but our negotiators whittled that down to five and a half years, during which the UK’s share - in that five and a half years – the UK’s share of our fish in our waters will rise from over half today to around two thirds. And of course we would like to have done this more quickly, but it’s also true that once the adjustment period comes to an end, there will be no limit Mr speaker – other than the limits placed by the needs of science and conservation – on our ability to make use of our marine wealth, and 15 per cent of the EU’s historic catch from our waters will be returned to this country next year alone. And as I say to prepare our fishing communities for that moment, we will invest £100 million in a programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry, Restoring Mr Speaker a great British industry to the eminence that it deserves, levelling up communities across the UK – particularly and including in Scotland Where their interests in my view have been neglected for too long. So I do find it extraordinary that on the eve of this great opportunity the declared position of the Scottish National nationalist Party is to hand control – with a small n – is to hand control of the very waters we have just reclaimed straight back to the EU. That is their policy Mr Speaker. And they plan to ensnare Scotland’s fishing fleet in the dragnets of the Common Fisheries Policy all over again. And, in the meantime, Mr Speaker – guess what they are going to do today - they are going to vote today for a “No Deal Brexit”, proving once and for all, that the interests of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are best served by a One Nation party serving One United Kingdom. Mr Speaker, this deal was negotiated by a big team, and he should know this, from every part of our United Kingdom, and it serves the whole of the UK, not least by protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom single internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it. Our points-based immigration system will end free movement and give us full control over who enters our country and by the way on that point I want to thank very much my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for all he did to protect the interest of Northern Ireland. And at the same time the deal provides certainty for airlines and hauliers – who have suffered grievously during this pandemic – It guarantees the freedom of British citizens to travel to and from the EU, and retain access to healthcare. It provides certainty for our police, for our border forces, for our security agencies, who work alongside our European friends to keep our people safe. They are going to vote against this Mr Speaker. It provides certainty for our partnerships on scientific research, because we want our country to be a science superpower, but also a collaborative science superpower. And it provides certainty for business Mr Speaker. from financial services to our world leading manufactures, including our car industry, safeguarding highly skilled jobs and investment across our country. As for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker, I am delighted that he has found yet another position on Brexit, and having plunged down every blind alley and exhausted every possible alternative, he has come to the right conclusion, namely to vote for this agreement which this Government has secured. But alas the good news about the Labour party stops there Because I’m told the Right Honourable Gentleman intends to ask the British people for a mandate to rewrite the deal in 2024. That’s what he wants to do. I think frankly Mr Speaker we got Brexit done, let’s keep Brexit done, and let’s keep Brexit done, and let’s press ahead with this Government’s mission to unite and level up across our whole country and grasp the opportunities before us. Because I have always said that Brexit is not an end but a beginning, and the responsibility now rests with all of us to make the best use of the powers that we have regained, and the tools that we have taken back into our hands. And we’re going to begin by fulfilling our manifesto promise to maintain the highest standards of labour and environmental regulation, because no caricature could be more inaccurate than the idea of some bargain basement, Dickensian Britain, as if enlightened EU regulation has in the past been our only salvation from Dickensian squalor. Our national standards have always been among the very best in the world and this House can be trusted to use its new freedom to keep them that way, without any outside invigilation. We are going to open Mr Speaker a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world, adding to the agreements with 63 countries we have already achieved, and reasserting Global Britain as a liberal, outward-looking force for good. Detaching ourselves from the EU is only a prelude to the greater task of establishing our new role, and this country is contributing more than any other to vaccinate people across the world against Covid and leading the way in preventing future pandemics and we will continue to campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world and I thank my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary for what he’s doing on that, and we will continue to lead the drive towards global net zero, as we host COP26 in Glasgow next year. And I hope and believe – and I think actually the tone this morning has given me encouragement in this belief Mr Speaker – the mood in the House this morning which seems to me on the whole to be positive. I hope in spite of the as usual, thin, synthetic, confected indignation that we hear from some of the benches opposite – I hope and believe that this agreement will also serve to end some of the rancour and recrimination that we’ve had in recent years, allow us to come to together as a country, to leave old arguments, old desiccated super masticated arguments behind, move on and build a new and great future for our country. Because those of us who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU never sought a rupture with our closest neighbours. We never wanted to sever ourselves from fellow democracies beneath whose soil lie British war graves in tranquil cemeteries, often tended by local schoolchildren, testament to our shared struggle for freedom and everything we cherish in common. What we wanted was not a rupture but a resolution, a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which has bedevilled our post-War history. First, we stood aloof, then we became a half-hearted, sometimes obstructive member of the EU. Now, with this Bill, we are going to become a friendly neighbour   – the best friend and ally the EU could have –  working hand-in-glove whenever our values and interests coincide while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own laws,  made by their own elected Parliament. That is the historic resolution delivered by this Bill and Mr Speaker I commend it to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on EU negotiations: 24 December 2020 It is four and a half years since the British people voted to take back control of their money, their borders, their laws, and their waters and to leave the European Union. And earlier this year we fulfilled that promise and we left on Jan 31 with that oven-ready deal. Since that time we have been getting on with our agenda. Enacting the points based immigration system that you voted for and that will come into force on Jan 1. And doing free trade deals with 58 countries around the world. And preparing the new relationship with the EU. And there have been plenty of people who have told us that the challenges of the Covid pandemic have made this work impossible. And that we should extend the transition period. And incur yet more delay. And I rejected that approach precisely because beating Covid is our number one national priority and I wanted to end any extra uncertainty and to give this country the best possible chance of bouncing back strongly next year. And so I am very pleased that this afternoon that we have completed the biggest trade deal yet, worth £660 billion. A comprehensive Canada style free trade deal between the UK and the EU, a deal that will protect jobs across this country. A deal that will allow UK goods and components to be sold without tariffs and without quotas in the EU market. A deal which will if anything should allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends. And yet which achieves something that the people of this country instinctively knew was doable. But which they were told was impossible. We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation. In a way that is complete and unfettered. From Jan 1 we are outside the customs union, and outside the single market. British laws will be made solely by the British Parliament. Interpreted by UK judges sitting in UK courts. And the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will come to an end. We will be able to set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want, to originate new frameworks for the sectors in which this country leads the world, from biosciences to financial services, artificial intelligence and beyond. We will be able to decide how and where we are going to stimulate new jobs and new hope. With freeports and new green industrial zones. We will be able to cherish our landscape and our environment in the way we choose. Backing our farmers and backing British food and agricultural production. And for the first time since 1973 we will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters with the UK’s share of fish in our waters rising substantially from roughly half today to closer to 2/3 in five and a half years’ time after which there is no theoretical limit beyond those placed by science or conservation on the quantity of our own fish that we can fish in our waters. And to get ready for that moment those fishing communities we will be helped with a big £100m programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry. And I want to stress that although of course the arguments with our European friends and partners were sometimes fierce this is, I believe a good deal for the whole of Europe and for our friends and partners as well. Because it will not be a bad thing for the EU to have a prosperous and dynamic and contented UK on your doorstep. And it will be a good thing – it will drive jobs and prosperity across the whole continent. And I don’t think it will be a bad thing if we in the UK do things differently, or a take a different approach to legislation. Because in so many ways our basic goals are the same. And in the context of this giant free trade zone that we’re jointly creating the stimulus of regulatory competition will I think benefit us both. And if one side believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut by the other, then subject to independent third party arbitration and provided the measures are proportionate, we can either of us decide – as sovereign equals - to protect our consumers. But this treaty explicitly envisages that such action should only happen infrequently and the concepts of uniformity and harmonisation are banished in favour of mutual respect and mutual recognition and free trade. And for squaring that circle, for finding the philosopher’s stone that’s enabled us to do this I want to thank President von der Leyen of the European Commission and our brilliant negotiators led by Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, on the EU side Stephanie Rousseau as well as Oliver Lewis, Tim Barrow, Lindsay Appleby and many others. Their work will be available for scrutiny, followed by a parliamentary vote I hope on Dec 30. This agreement, this deal above all means certainty. It means certainty for the aviation industry and the hauliers who have suffered so much in the Covid pandemic. It means certainty for the police and the border forces and the security services and all those that we rely on across Europe to keep us safe. It means certainty for our scientists who will be able to continue to work together on great collective projects. Because although we want the UK to be a science superpower, we also want to be a collaborative science superpower. And above all it means certainty for business from financial services to our world-leading manufacturers – our car industry – certainty for those working in high skilled jobs in firms and factories across the whole country. Because there will be no palisade of tariffs on Jan 1. And there will be no non-tariff barriers to trade. And instead there will be a giant free trade zone of which we will at once be a member. And at the same time be able to do our own free trade deals as one UK, whole and entire, England, NI, Scotland and Wales together. And I should stress this deal was done by a huge negotiating team from every part of the UK, and it will benefit every part of our United Kingdom, helping to unite and level up across the country. And so I say again directly to our EU friends and partners, I think this deal means a new stability and a new certainty in what has sometimes been a fractious and difficult relationship. We will be your friend, your ally, your supporter and indeed – never let it be forgotten – your number one market. Because although we have left the EU this country will remain culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the four million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives. And I say to all of you at home. At the end of this toughest of years. That our focus in the weeks ahead is of course on defeating the pandemic. And on beating coronavirus and rebuilding our economy. And delivering jobs across the country. And I am utterly confident that we can and will do it. By today we have vaccinated almost 800,000 people and we have also today resolved a question that has bedevilled our politics for decades. And it is up to us all together. As a newly and truly independent nation. To realise the immensity of this moment and to make the most of it. Happy Christmas to you all. That’s the good news from Brussels – now for the sprouts. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 December 2020 Good afternoon, I want to update everyone on one thing and that’s what’s happening at our borders and especially at Dover. Last night at 11pm the French Government imposed restrictions on UK freight crossing to France when accompanied by a driver. And so today I chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency, COBR committee in order to co-ordinate a UK-wide response. And it is vital first to stress that these delays – which are only occurring at Dover – only affect human-handled freight, and that is only 20 per cent of the total arriving from or departing to the European continent, which means the vast majority of food, medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal. You may also be aware – in fact I’d be amazed if you weren’t – that the government has been preparing for a long time for this exactly kind of event. So working with the Kent Resilience Forum, Kent County Council and Highways England, we’ve activated our long-prepared plans, with the result that we have already been able to reduce the number of lorries waiting on the M20 from 500 to 170. The site at Manston Airfield is ready to cope with any overflow. And, of course, we are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade as fast as possible. The Government at all levels is communicating with our friends in Paris I have just spoken to President Macron - we had a very good call - we both understand each other’s positions and want to resolve these problems as fast as possible. I know that Grant is also speaking to his counterpart and we are working to a solution, as I say, as fast as we can to allow freight traffic to resume between the UK and France, and ensure that lorries can travel in both directions in a Covid-secure way. I want to stress that we in the UK fully understand the anxieties of our friends about Covid, their anxieties about the new variant, but it is also true that we believe the risks of transmission by a solitary driver sitting alone in the cab are really very low. And so we hope to make progress as fast as we possibly can. I want to repeat that these delays only apply to a very small percentage of food entering the UK, and as British supermarkets have said, their supply chains are strong and robust, so everyone can continue to shop normally. And to our international friends and partners I want to say very frankly: We understand your concerns, And I hope that everybody can see that as soon as we were briefed as a government of the fast transmissibility of this new strain at about 3.15pm on Friday afternoon, We lodged all the necessary information with the World Health Organisation And we took prompt and decisive action the very next day to curb the spread of the variant within the UK. And we want to work with our colleagues, with our friends around the world, as we have from the beginning to develop new treatments and new vaccines. And today I can announce that half a million people in the UK have now received their first dose. As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, this virus alas can move all too swiftly from one nation to another, But it is steadily being defeated by an international response An international response that is bringing the hope of vaccines to the entire world, And in that the UK will continue to play our full part. I’ll now handover to our Secretary of State, Grant. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I am sorry to report that the situation has deteriorated since I last spoke to you three days ago. Yesterday afternoon, I was briefed on the latest data showing the virus spreading more rapidly in London, the South East and the East of England than would be expected given the tough restrictions which are already in place. I also received an explanation for why the virus is spreading more rapidly in these areas. It appears this spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus, which we first learned about earlier this week. Our advisory group on New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats – NERVTAG – has spent the last few days analysing the new variant. There is no evidence the variant causes more severe illness or higher mortality, but it does appear to be passed on significantly more easily. NERVTAG’s early analysis suggests the new variant could increase R by 0.4 or greater. Although there is considerable uncertainty, it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant. This is early data. It is subject to review. It is the best we have at the moment, and we have to act on information as we have it because this is now spreading very fast. The U.K. has by far the best genomic sequencing ability in the world, which means we are better able to identify new strains like this than any other country. The Chief Medical Officer last night submitted our findings so far to the World Health Organisation and we will continue to be totally transparent with our global partners. There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant. Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant. So we are learning more about this variant as we go. But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now. I met ministers on the Covid Operations Committee last night and again first thing this morning, and Cabinet met at lunchtime to agree the following actions. First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3. These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November. That means: Residents in those areas must stay at home, apart from limited exemptions set out in law.
Non-essential retail, indoor gyms and leisure facilities, and personal care services must close.
People must work from home if they can, but may travel to work if this is not possible, for example in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
People should not enter or leave tier 4 areas, and tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home.
Individuals can only meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space. Unlike the November national restrictions, communal worship can continue to take place in tier 4 areas. These measures will take effect from tomorrow morning. All tiers will continue to be regularly reviewed in line with the approach previously set out, with the next formal review point taking place on 30 December. Second, we are issuing new advice on travel. Although the new variant is concentrated in tier 4 areas, it is nonetheless present at lower levels around the country. We are asking everyone, in all tiers, to stay local. People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier. Those in tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes. Third, we must, I am afraid, look again at Christmas. As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned. In England, those living in tier 4 areas should not mix with anyone outside their own household at Christmas, though support bubbles will remain in place for those at particular risk of loneliness or isolation. Across the rest of the country, the Christmas rules allowing up to three households to meet will now be limited to Christmas Day only, rather than the five days as previously set out. As before, there will be no relaxation on 31 December, so people must not break the rules at New Year. I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren, and for families to be together. So I know how disappointing this will be, but we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response. When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defence. As your Prime Minister, I sincerely believe there is no alternative open to me. Without action, the evidence suggests infections would soar, hospitals would become overwhelmed and many thousands more would lose their lives. I want to stress we are not alone in this fight – many of our European friends and neighbours are being forced to take similar action. We are working closely with the devolved administrations to protect people in every part of the UK. Of course there is now hope – real hope – that we will soon be rid of this virus. That prospect is growing with every day that passes and every vaccine dose administered. The UK was the first country in the western world to start using a clinically approve vaccine. So please, if the NHS contacts you then get your vaccine – and join the 350,000 people across the UK who have already had their first dose. Yes, Christmas this year will be very different, but we must be realistic. We are sacrificing our chance to see loved ones this Christmas, so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so we can see them at future Christmases. As sure as night follows day, we will beat back this virus. We will defeat it. And we will reclaim our lives. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020 It is just a week since the United Kingdom began the biggest vaccination programme in our history. And the public is coming forward at an extraordinary pace to get a jab, to protect themselves, beginning with the elderly and the most vulnerable. With 138,000 recipients of the first dose – and more joining them every minute - there is no doubt we are winning and we will win our long struggle against this virus which makes it all the more important that we hold our nerve this winter. Because we are now in a race to protect us all while doing everything we can to keep the virus under control. And thanks to the colossal collective effort in November we did bring the R below 1 we did get the infection rate down. But I must be frank with you we are already seeing worrying rises in some parts of the country: Kent is still seeing rising infections the number of cases in London is at 270 per 100,000 people. And that’s why we acted quickly by moving London into Tier 3 from today. And tomorrow the Health Secretary will announce the outcome of the latest tiering review. And so like every other European country facing similar challenges we have come to this moment, a great global festival a turning point, a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance. But also a moment for us to exercise extreme caution when we must remember that one of the most striking features of this virus is that it spreads invisibly from people who don’t even have symptoms which is in fact around 1 in 3 of everyone infected. And that’s why from the beginning this virus has been so hard to fight and that’s why it’s so important to follow the rules and why this Christmas it’s vital that everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility. And having looked at the latest data – with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we have decided that the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules. So while it would not be right to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones, we are all collectively across the UK, governments at every level, asking you to think hard and in detail about the days ahead and whether you can do more to protect yourself and others. We are keeping the laws the same – but we all want to send the same message: a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas. When we say three households can meet on five days, I want to stress these are maximums, not targets to aim for. And of course it is always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet. And that means that if you are visiting others over Christmas, we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday - to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possible because this virus spreads from human contact. If possible don’t travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence area and avoid staying away from home overnight if you can. Remember, the vaccine is on the way and our aim is to inoculate everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable or elderly in the early months of next year. So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others. And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated. And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day Sales And no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year – remember the rules in your local area will apply. In most places across the UK, I’m afraid that means you cannot mix with other households indoors. All the information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones is being made available on gov.uk. So have yourselves a merry little Christmas And I’m afraid this year I do mean little But with the vaccine, and all the other measures that we are taking, We do know things will be better in this country by Easter And I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal for every family in the country. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 2 December It is almost a year since humanity has been tormented by COVID Across the world, economic output has plummeted and a million and a half people have died And all the time we have waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy And give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill – and now the scientists have done it And they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine from an idea that was pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner in 1796 And today we can announce that the government has accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for distribution across the United Kingdom. after months of clinical trials, involving thousands of people to ensure that the vaccine meets the strictest, internationally recognised, standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. Thanks to the fantastic work of Kate Bingham and the Vaccines Task Force, we purchased more than 350 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates, and the UK was the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this Pfizer vaccine securing 40 million doses. Through our Winter Plan, the NHS has been preparing for the biggest programme of mass vaccination in the history of the UK. And that is going to begin next week, and in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation the first phase will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, But there are immense logistical challenges: the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart. So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected, Long and cold months So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism Or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over Its not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan, a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus, protect the NHS and the vulnerable, keep education and the economy going and use treatments, testing and vaccines to enable us to return to much closer to normal by spring. Today in England we have ended national restrictions, opening up significant parts of the economy in doing so; but also replacing them with tough tiers to keep this virus down. And I know that those tiers will mean continued hardship for many, and it is going to continue to be tough for some sectors but until the vaccine is deployed, our plan does rely on all of us continuing to make sacrifices to protect those we love. So please, please continue to follow the rules where you live, remember hands, face, space – and if you live in a tier 3 area where community testing will be made available, please take part in that community testing. Together, these steps are for now the surest way to protect yourselves and those you love and by reducing the transmission of the virus, help de-escalate your area to a lower level of restrictions, as vaccines and testing, as I say, take an ever larger share of the burden. And as we do all this, we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed: and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations now be approved. And I want to begin by telling the House that I was hugely encouraged by a visit I paid only yesterday to a vaccine plant in North Wales where I saw for myself the vials of one of seven vaccines backed by the UK Government that could turn the tide of our struggle against Covid, not just in this country but around the world. It is the protection of those vaccines that could get our economies moving again, and allow us to reclaim our lives. And that one plant in Wrexham could produce 300 million doses a year and yesterday was the momentous day when it began to manufacture the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And it was a very moving moment Mr Speaker when I talked to one of the brilliant young scientists there, And she described the extraordinary moment for her in her life, to be part of an enterprise that was she thought truly going to offer humanity a route out of this suffering. But Mr Speaker, we have to be realistic, And we have to accept that this vaccine is not here yet, no vaccine is here yet and while all the signs are promising and almost every scientist I’ve talked to agrees that the breakthrough will surely come we do not yet have one that has gained regulatory approval. We can’t be completely sure when the moment will arrive and until then we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter. The national measures which are now shortly ending in England have eased the burden on the NHS and begun to reverse the advance of the virus. Today, the R is back below 1 and the ONS survey is showing that signs of the infection rate are levelling off and Imperial College London has found that the number of people with Covid has fallen by a third in England since 2nd November. But while the virus has been contained, it has not been eradicated. The latest ONS figures suggest that out of every 85 people in England, one has Coronavirus; far more than in the Summer between 24th November and yesterday, 3,222 people across the UK lost their lives; and despite the immense progress of the last four weeks, our NHS remains under pressure, with hospitals in three regions – the South West, the North East and Yorkshire - all treating more Covid patients now than at the peak of the first wave. So we can’t simply allow the current restrictions to expire for the reason he gives with no replacement whatever. With the spread of the epidemic varying across the country, there remains a compelling case for regional tiers in England and indeed Mr Speaker a compelling necessity for regional tiers. But I hope the House is clear what I am not asking for today. This is not another lockdown, nor is this the renewal of the existing measures in England. The tiers that I am proposing would mean that from tomorrow everyone in England – including those in tier 3 – will be free to leave their homes for any reason. And when they do, they will find the shops open for Christmas, the hairdressers open, the nail bars open, gyms and leisure centres, swimming pools open, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples will be open for communal worship. Organised outdoor sport will resume, and in every tier you will be able to meet others in parks and in public gardens subject to the Rule of Six. And every one of those things has been by necessity restricted until today. Every one of them would be allowed again tomorrow. Of course I accept that this is not a return to normality. I wish it were so. But it is a bit closer to normality than the present restrictions. And what we cannot do is lift all of the restrictions at once, or move too quickly, in such a way that the virus would begin to spread rapidly again. That would be the surest way of endangering our NHS and forcing us into a new year lockdown, with all the costs that that would impose. We all accept that the burden on the hospitality sector has been very great. We feel this deeply, because our pubs, our hotels, restaurants they are in many ways the heart of the communities And part of the fabric of our identity as a country And everybody can see that the hospitality industry has borne a disproportionate share of the burden in this crisis. There’s no question about it. And that is obviously because we want to keep schools open Mr Speaker and we have to take such measures as we can. I would just remind the House however, that we are not alone in this. In France bars, restaurants and gyms will not reopen until 20th January at the earliest. In Germany, the hospitality sector will remain closed in its entirety over Christmas. But we will do everything in our power to support our hospitality sector throughout this crisis. We have already extended the furlough scheme for all businesses until the end of March, We’ve provided monthly grants of up to £3,000 for premises forced to close, and £2,100 for those that remain open but have suffered because of reduced demand. We have allocated £1.1 billion for local authorities to support businesses at particular risk. And today Mr Speaker we are going further with a one-off payment of £1,000 in December to wet pubs – that is Mr Speaker pubs that do not serve food as the House knows recognising how hard they have been hit by this virus in what is typically their busiest month. We will also work with the hospitality sector in supporting their bounce back next year. Mr Speaker I want to stress, that the situation is profoundly different now because there is an end in sight. And I am not this afternoon seeking open-ended measures. On the contrary, these regulations come with a sunset clause at the end of February, sorry at the end of the 2 February I should say Mr Speaker. At that point we will have sufficient data to assess our position after Christmas, and though I believe these types of restrictions will be needed until the Spring, they can only be extended beyond 2 February if this House votes for them Mr Speaker. These are points that have been made with great power as I say by Hon Members on all sides of the House. We will review the allocation of tiers every fourteen days, starting on 16th December. I just want to make an important point to my Rt Hon friend and to all members who are rightly concerned about the position of their constituencies, our constituencies, in these tiers. Hon Members have it in their powers, in our power to help move our areas down the tiers, by throwing their full weight Mr Speaker, our full weight as leaders in our communities behind community testing, and seizing the opportunity, seizing the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to take part. Of the kind we’ve seen in Liverpool Mr Speaker where since the 6th November over 284,000 tests have been conducted, and together with the effect of national restrictions, the number of cases fell by more than two thirds. This is the model that I would recommend. We are now proposing that from tomorrow Liverpool City Region and Warrington should be in tier 2, where as previously obviously they were in tier 3. And we want other regions and other towns, cities, communities to follow this path, And that is why – with the help of our fantastic armed forces – we will be offering community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible. Mr Speaker let me just say, I find it extraordinary that the Official Opposition –represented by the gentleman opposite - Currently have no view on the way ahead and are not proposing to vote tonight. I do think it is extraordinary that in spite of the barrage of criticism that we have no credible plan from the party opposite. Indeed, we have no view on the way ahead. It’s a quite extraordinary thing Mr Speaker that tonight to the best of my knowledge The RHG Opposite who has always said he will ‘act in the national interest’ has told his party to sit on its hands and to abstain in the vote tonight Mr Speaker. And I think the government has made its decision, we’ve taken some tough decisions Mr Speaker and the Labour opposition has decided tonight heroically to abstain Mr Speaker And I think when the history of this pandemic comes to be written, I think the people of this country will observe that instead of having politicians of all parties coming together in the national interest they had one party taking the decisions and another party heroically deciding to abstain Mr Speaker, in the story of 2020, I think there are two great feats in which we can take a great deal of comfort. First, our country has come together in an extraordinary effort that has so far succeeded in protecting our NHS and in saving many lives. And while our scientists have been zeroing in on the weaknesses of Covid, telescoping ten years of work into ten months, and now their endeavours are about to deliver the means as I say to rout the virus. That is clear. The Government is backing not one potential vaccine, but seven. We have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that is now seeking regulatory approval. We have ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which has almost 95 per cent effectiveness in trials. And Mr Speaker, we have ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which if approved by the regulator – could start being administered before Christmas. In total, Mr Speaker our Vaccines Task Force has secured more than 350 million doses, more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and our Overseas Territories. All we need to do now Mr Speaker is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp, and indeed being injected into our arms. So I say to the House again let us follow the guidance, let us roll out mass testing, let’s work to deliver mass testing to the people of our country, let’s work together to control the virus and it is in that spirit that I commend these regulations Mr Speaker I commend these regulations to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020 We now have reason to hope that by Spring, community testing and vaccines will combine to end this era of restrictions. But to get there we must first navigate a hard winter when the burden on our NHS is heaviest and the cold weather favours the virus. The data already suggests national measures in England have slowed - and in some places reversed - the growth of new cases. As more data comes in, we hope and expect to see those trends continue. Together we have prevented our NHS from being overwhelmed, but those dangers have not gone away. If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean. The tough measures in our Winter Plan are the best way to avoid this outcome. All our friends around the world are grappling with the same question of how to keep people safe without retreating into a winter of hibernation. In Italy there is a nightly curfew, in Germany, hospitality will remain closed until 20th December, and in France, until 20 January. Across the whole of the UK, measures remain in place to control the virus. Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions. Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators: cases across all ages, especially the over 60s, the rate by which cases are rising or falling the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and the pressure on the NHS. We are publishing data packs setting out the reasons behind decisions in each area. To find out how this affects you, log on to gov.uk where all the information is available. I’m sorry to confirm that, from Wednesday, most of England will be in the top two tiers with the toughest measures. I know this will bring a great deal of heartache and frustration, especially for our vital hospitality sector, our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, in so many ways the soul of our communities - which continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden. I really wish it were otherwise, but if we are to keep schools open – as we must - then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited. What we will do is continue taking every possible step to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. These tougher tiers strike a balance – they are sufficient to continue driving the virus downwards but it’s important to recognise they are less intrusive than the current national measures. In all tiers, shops, gyms and the leisure sector, hairdressers, other forms of personal care, places of worship will reopen. You will no longer be instructed to stay at home, though you should continue to work from home if you can. The rule of 6 will once again apply in public outdoor spaces and organised outdoor sport can begin again. But there is no doubt that the restrictions in all tiers are tough – and I am sorry about that. While the data is beginning to improve, the virus is still prevalent, and the faster we drive it down the faster we can lift restrictions. And that is exactly what these new tiers are designed to achieve. While the previous tiers slowed the spread of the virus, they were never quite enough to cut the R below 1 and keep it there, so areas did not escape whatever level they were placed in. Our new approach is designed to reduce R below 1, opening a path for areas to move down the scale, as soon as the situation improves. And crucially, we now have the means to accelerate that moment of escape with rapid community testing, allowing anyone carrying the disease - including those without symptoms – to isolate thereby reducing the R. And the truth is that at least one in three people with Covid have no symptoms at all and may be spreading the disease without even knowing that they’ve got it. The only way to identify them and protect everyone is through mass testing. Liverpool shows what can be achieved. In Liverpool, in the space of two and a half weeks, over 240,000 tests have been conducted and together with the effect of national restrictions, this has helped to reduce the number of cases in Liverpool City Region by more than two thirds. So having previously been in tier 3, Liverpool City Region and Warrington will now be in tier 2. This is a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate so we will work with local government, public health leaders and our fantastic Armed Forces, to offer community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible, opening the way for them to follow Liverpool’s example. Testing on this scale is untried, but in due course, if it works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictions even if their home area stays in tier 3. The allocation of tiers will be reviewed every fourteen days, starting on 16 December. So your tier is not your destiny. Every area has the means of escape. And I have no doubt that together we can get through this Winter, suppress the virus until vaccines come to our aid, and then reclaim our lives and all the things that we love. 

Boris:


It seems that almost every week we learn of some new scientific breakthrough to help us beat Covid last week it was good news about the vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech and then Moderna This morning we heard the fantastic news that the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine has been highly effective in clinical trials there are more tests to be done, but the signs are that this vaccine 
financed partly by British taxpayers, working in partnership with a great British company –

This vaccine could be both affordable and easy to use and highly effective We have ordered 100m doses and thanks to the work of the Vaccines Task Force we have secured more than 350m doses of potential vaccines of all kinds but we are not out of the woods yet we can hear the drumming hooves of the cavalry coming over the brow of the hill but they are not here yet Even if all three vaccines are approved, even if the production timetables are met and vaccines notoriously fall behind in their production timetables it will be months before we can be sure that we have inoculated everyone that needs a vaccine and those months will be hard they will be cold they include January and February when the NHS is under its greatest pressure and that is why when we come out of lockdown next week we must not just throw away the gains we have all made So today we have published out Covid Winter Plan which sets out a clear strategy to take the country through to the end of March We will continue to bear down hard on this virus we will use tough tiering - in some ways tougher than the pre-lockdown measures and details of those tiers are on the gov.uk website later this week when we have the most up to data and we will be sharing details of which tier your area is going to be in I should warn you now that many more places will be in higher tiers than alas was previously the case and we will simultaneously be using the new and exciting possibilities of community testing - as they have done in Liverpool and there will be a clear incentive for everyone in areas where the virus prevalence is high to get a test, to get one of these rapid turnaround lateral flow tests and do your best for the community get a test to help to squeeze the disease and reduce the restrictions that your town or city or area has endured and that way - through tough tiering and mass community testing we hope to let people see a little more of their family and friends over Christmas Now I know that many of us want and need Christmas with our families we feel after this year we deserve it but this is not the moment to let the virus rip for the sake of Christmas parties tis the season to be jolly but tis also the season to be jolly careful especially with elderly relatives and working with the Devolved Administrations we will set out shortly how we want to get the balance right for Christmas and we will be setting this out later this week Christmas this year will be different and we want to remain prudent through Christmas and beyond into the new year but we will use the three tools that I have described to squeeze the virus in the weeks and months ahead tiering, testing and the roll-out of vaccines employing all three techniques together so as to drive down R and drive down the infection rate and I really am now assured things really will look and feel very different indeed after Easter and that idea of and end goal or date is important because at last - if the promise of the vaccines is fulfilled - we do have something to work for a timescale, a goal around which businesses can begin tentatively to plan and with luck and with hard work we will be seeing improvements before then but for now the problem is not a shortage of hope or a lack of optimism not with the amazing news that we are getting from the laboratories in this country the challenge now as we face this difficult winter ahead is to fight down any over-optimism to master any tendency to premature celebration of success that success will come all the faster if we work together to follow the guidance maintain the basic disciplines as people have done so heroically over the last few months hands, face, space and get a test if you have symptoms because that is the way we will beat it together 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, thank you and with permission, I will update the House on the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy. Our Review will conclude early next year, setting out the UK’s international agenda, but I want to inform the House of its first outcome. For decades, British governments have trimmed and cheese-pared our defence budget and if we go on like this, we risk waking up to discover that our armed forces – the pride of Britain – have fallen below the minimum threshold of viability, and once lost, they could never be regained. That outcome would not only be craven, it would jeopardise the security of the British people, amounting to a dereliction of duty for any Prime Minister. So I refused to vindicate any pessimistic forecasters there have been by taking up the scalpel yet again. Based on our assessment of the international situation and our foreign policy goals, I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end – and it ends now. I am increasing defence spending by £24.1 billion over the next four years, That’s £16.5 billion more than our manifesto commitment - raising it as a share of GDP to at least 2.2 percent, exceeding our NATO pledge, and investing £190 billion over the next four years, more than any other European country and more than any other NATO ally, except the United States. The Ministry of Defence has received a multi-year settlement because equipping our armed forces requires long term investment, and our national security in 20 years’ time will depend on decisions we take today. I have done this in the teeth of the pandemic, amid every other demand on our resources, because the defence of the realm, and the safety of the British people, must come first. I pay tribute to my Right Honourable Friends the Chancellor and Defence Secretary, who believe in this as fervently as I do. Reviving our armed forces is one pillar of the Government’s ambition to safeguard Britain’s interests and values by strengthening our global influence, and reinforcing our ability to join the United States and our other allies to defend free and open societies. The international situation is now more perilous and intensely competitive than at any time since the Cold War. Everything we do in this country – every job, every business, even how we shop and what we eat – depends on a basic minimum of global security. Our people are sustained by a web of lifelines, oxygen pipes that must be kept open open shipping lanes, a functioning internet, safe air corridors, reliable undersea cables, and tranquillity in distant straits. This pandemic has offered a taste of what happens when elemental requirements are suddenly in question. We could take all this for granted, ignore the threat of terrorism and the ambitions of hostile states, and hope for the best, and we might get away with it for a while, before calamity strikes, as it surely would. Or we could accept that our lifelines must be protected, but we are content to curl up in our island and leave the task to our friends. My starting point is that either of those options would be an abdication of the first duty of Government to defend our people. My choice – and I hope it will carry every member of this House – is that Britain must be true to our history, To stand alongside our allies, sharing the burden and bringing our expertise to bear on the world’s toughest problems. To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board. We have already united our international effort into a new department combining aid and diplomacy, Led with grit and purpose by my RH Friend the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Secretary. Next year will be a year of British leadership, when we preside over the G7, host COP-26 in Glasgow and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first United Nations General Assembly in London. We are leading the world towards net zero with our ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, and we are campaigning for our values, particularly freedom of religion and the media, and giving every girl in the world access to 12 years of quality education. But extending British influence requires a once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces, and now is the right time to press ahead because emerging technologies, visible on the horizon, will make the returns from defence investment infinitely greater. We have a chance to break free from the vicious circle, whereby we ordered ever-decreasing numbers of ever more expensive items of military hardware, squandering billions along the way. The latest advances will multiply the fighting power of every warship, aircraft and infantry unit many times over, and the prizes will go to the swiftest and most agile nations, not necessarily the biggest. We can achieve as much as British ingenuity and expertise allow. We will need to act speedily to remove or reduce less relevant capabilities – and this will allow our new investment to be focused on the technologies that will revolutionise warfare, forging our military assets into a single network designed to overcome the enemy. A soldier in hostile territory will be alerted to a distant ambush by sensors on satellites or drones, instantly transmitting a warning, using Artificial Intelligence to devise the optimal response, and offering an array of options, from summoning an air strike to ordering a swarm attack, by drones or paralysing the enemy with cyber weapons. New advances will surmount the old limits of logistics. Our warships and combat vehicles will carry “directed energy weapons”, destroying targets with inexhaustible lasers and for them the phrase “out of ammunition” will become redundant. Nations are racing to master this new doctrine of warfare and our investment is designed to place Britain among the winners. The returns will go far beyond our Armed Forces. From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications, opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year – 40,000 in total - levelling up across our country and reinforcing our Union. We shall use our extra defence spending to restore Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe, taking forward our plans for eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates, and support ships to supply our carriers. We are going to develop the next generation of warships, including multi-role research vessels and Type 32 frigates. And this will spur a renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK – in Glasgow and Rosyth, Belfast, Appledore and Birkenhead – guaranteeing jobs and illuminating the benefits of the Union in the white light of the arc welder’s torch. If there was one policy which strengthens the UK in every possible sense, it is building more ships for the Royal Navy. Once both of our carriers are operational in 2023, the UK will have a Carrier Strike Group permanently available, routinely deployed globally and always ready to fight alongside NATO and other allies. Next year HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades, encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia. We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation, and we shall press on with renewing our nuclear deterrent. We shall reshape our army for the age of networked warfare, allowing better equipped soldiers to deploy more quickly, and strengthening the ability of our Special Forces to operate covertly against our most sophisticated adversaries. Our security and intelligence agencies will continue to protect us around the clock from terrorism and new and evolving threats, We shall invest another £1.5 billion in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare, and we will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and a new RAF Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022. I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel, which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity. And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat. Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe. The defence of the realm is above party politics and we all take pride in how British resolve saved democracy in 1940, and British internationalism – directed by Clement Attlee - helped to create NATO and preserve peace through the Cold War. The wisdom and pragmatism of Margaret Thatcher found a path out of confrontation when she met Mikhail Gorbachev in 1984. In each case, Britain tipped the scales of history and did immense good for the world. Now we have a chance to follow in this great tradition, to end the era of retreat, transform our armed forces, bolster our global influence, unite and level up across our country, protect our people, and defend the free societies in which we fervently believe. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 9 November 2020 Across the country and around the world this evening, people are asking one question about our fight against Covid, does the news of progress towards a vaccine – that’s been announced today - mean we are at the beginning of the end of our troubles? So, let me set out our assessment. The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus. But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data, and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed. So we have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used. What I can say is that if and when this vaccine is approved, we, in this country, will be ready to start using it. Earlier this year the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the population, since you need two doses each. That puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis – and I should add we’ve ordered over 300 million doses from 5 other vaccine candidates as well. If the Pfizer vaccine passes all the rigorous safety checks and is proved to be effective then we will begin a UK-wide NHS led programme of vaccine distribution. We will decide the order in which people are offered the vaccination taking account of recommendations from a group of scientific experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They’re looking at a range of factors, including the different characteristics of different types of vaccines, to work out the most effective way to protect as many people as possible and save as many lives as we can. And we will be setting out more detail about that in due course. But – and you know I am going to say this - I must stress, these are very, very early days. We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill And tonight that toot of the bugle is louder. But it is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution. The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment. On Friday, SAGE reported that the R is above 1 in England – though this does not take into account the current national restrictions. Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days ago The number of Covid patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on 5 November, and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak. Irrespective of whether there is a vaccine on the way or not we must continue to do everything possible right now to bring the R down. And that is why we hope and believe that mass testing will help. Our first pilot began in Liverpool on Friday, in partnership with Liverpool City Council. We’ve tested thousands of people there but there are still a lot more to do, so please if you are in Liverpool, get yourself along to a testing centre – there are 19 at the moment with more still to come. The more people get tested the better we can protect that great city, and drive the disease down in Liverpool so do it for your friends, for your relatives, for your community. And I want to thank the fantastic support of the army, the people of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council. And we are now going further by sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England - and also of course to the Devolved Administrations. We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country. But while we are making progress this project is still in its infancy. And neither mass testing nor progress on vaccines –both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver, both key parts of our fight against Covid - are at the present time a substitute for the national restrictions, for social distancing, for hand hygiene and all the rest. So it is all the more important to follow the rules. I know it’s been a tough first weekend of these Autumn restrictions and I’m especially grateful to the Royal British Legion and all those who worked so hard to ensure that no virus would stop us yesterday from honouring the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. But we must get through this to 2nd December, when these measures expire and we plan to move forward with a tiered approach. Remember the basics, hands, face, space, and the follow the rules, that is how we can together protect our NHS, save lives and get this virus back in its box. And that is what we will do. So thank you. And I’m now going to hand over to Brigadier Fossey to talk about how the unrivalled logistical expertise of the British army that’s helping to deliver mass testing to Liverpool. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 5 November 2020 Good evening everyone, Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box.
Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people. We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK. We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK. Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives. The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live. The challenges we face are significant across the U.K. The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier. There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier. 1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier. Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier. That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK. In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home. As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies. The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do. I know how tough this is: For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline. For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to. For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet. I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures though they are tough are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists. Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool. I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus. More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines. So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead. And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions. As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March. We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits. We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month. We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses. And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need. As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation. Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter. These are difficult times. And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this. So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations are approved and that we come together today to implement time-limited restrictions across England from midnight, so we can contain the Autumn surge of the virus,
protect our NHS and save many lives. Of course, this not something that any of us wanted to do. None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, To furlough their staff, or stay away from their friends and family. And I feel the pain and anxiety that we all share in the month ahead. But as Prime Minister, when I am confronted with data that projects our NHS could even collapse, with deaths in this second wave potentially exceeding those of the first; and when I look at what is happening now amongst some of our continental friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered alas to work on covid wards,
and patients airlifted to hospitals in some other countries simply to make space, I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people. And I know, Mr Speaker, it might be tempting to think that because some progress has been made we just need to stay the course and see through our locally led approach. And it is true that the extraordinary efforts of millions across the country especially those in high and very high alert level areas – they have made a difference, Mr Speaker suppressing the R, the reproduction rate of the virus below where it would have otherwise have been And I want to record again my thanks again to the millions who have put up with local restrictions, and I want to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. But I am sorry to say that the number of Covid patients in some hospitals is already higher than at the peak of the first wave. Even in the South West, which has so far had lower case rates than most of the rest of the country, hospital admissions are over half way to their first wave peak. SAGE’s latest analysis, published on Friday, suggests that the R remains above 1 in every part of England,
which means the virus is continuing to grow among the population. And every day that the number is above one, is another day that the number of cases will rise locking in, more hospital admissions and alas more fatalities. and pushing the NHS ever closer to the moment when it cannot cope. The course we have before us is to prevent the R from going back remaining above one and to get it down. Otherwise we face a bleak and an uncertain future of steadily rising infections and admissions until as I say the capacity of the NHS is breached. And I know there has been some debate about the projections from some of these models, for example, exactly how big the loss of life might be, or the precise point at which the NHS might be overwhelmed, but all the scientific experts that I have talked to are unanimous on one point As the Chief Medical Officer has said –
“if we did not act now, then the chance of the NHS being in extraordinary trouble in December would be very, very high.” And be in no doubt Mr Speaker what that means for our country and for our society. It means that the precious principle - of care for everyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – that principal could be shattered for the first time in our experience It means those who are sick and suffering and in need of help - could be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals Mr Speaker even in East Sussex Mr Speaker. Doctors and nurses could be forced to make impossible choices about which patients would live and would die, who would get oxygen and who couldn’t. And I know that there are some Members like my honourable friend who are hearing from their local hospitals that the pressure is not that great yet. But the whole point about a National Health Service, is that when hospitals in one part of the country are over-run,
sick patients are transferred to another, until the whole system falls over. And let me be clear this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, as is sometimes asserted but from not focusing enough. Because if we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would not only lead to the covid casualties that I’ve described but which would deprive other patients of the care they need. We simply cannot reach the point where our National Health Service is no longer there for everyone. And Mr Speaker this fate is not inevitable. We are moving to these national measures here when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were for instance in France, when President Macron took similar steps. If we act now and act decisively we can stem the rising waters before our defences are breached. And this approach, these regulations I do believe are the way we can do that. Mr Speaker, I know there are many in the House who are concerned about how long these measures might last, and that if people vote for these regulations today, they could suddenly find that we are trapped with these national measures for months on end. So let me level with the House. Of course, I cannot say exactly where the epidemiology will be by 2nd December, But what I can say is that the national measures – that I hope the House will vote on tonight - are time-limited. It is not that we choose to stop them. They legally expire. So whatever we decide to do from 2nd December will require a fresh mandate and a fresh vote from this House. And as I have made clear, it is my express intent that we should return to a tiered system on a local and a regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Mr Speaker, the whole House will share my sorrow and regret at the necessity of these measures,
particularly for businesses who had just got back on their feet Mr Speaker, who had done their level best to make themselves Covid-secure,
installing handwashing stations, plexiglass screens, one-way systems And as the Chancellor has set out, we will do whatever it takes to support them. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13 billion to help support the self-employed, and we are now doubling our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits for the self-employed for this month. We’re providing cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses who are closed - worth over £1 billion a month and benefiting over 600,000 business premises. We are giving funding of £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England, to further support businesses and their local economy in the winter months. And this comes on top of the more than £200 billion we’ve provided since March. And we will also ensure that throughout this period that our schools stay open. We will not allow this virus to do any further damage to the future of our children. I said in the Summer we had a moral duty to reopen our schools as soon as it was safe to do so and that they would be the last element of society to close down again. And we have stuck to that pledge Mr Speaker Our schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings. Mr Speaker, the measures before the House are designed to arrest the virus, to drive it down and to get on top of it once and for all. If we are able to test on a big enough scale to identify the people who are infected – often without symptoms and who unwittingly, asymptomatically pass the virus to others then those people will be helped immediately – this is the key thing - to self-isolate and break the chains of transmission, and reducing the spread of the virus –reducing the number of people in hospital, reducing the number of people dying. I think that if we all play our part in this system it could be a hugely valuable weapon in our fight against Covid in the short medium and long term, and an alternative to the blanket restrictions that have been imposed in so many parts of the world. We are piloting this week a mass test in Liverpool, where an immense effort benefiting from the logistical skill of the armed services will offer everyone a test. And our aim is to make mass and repeated testing available for everyone across the country. Thanks to the pioneering work of British scientists, we already have a life-saving treatment for Covid and the genuine possibility of a safe and effective vaccine next year. Taken together, these achievements provide every reason for confidence that our country can and will pull through this crisis and that our ingenuity will prove equal to the challenge. Mr Speaker, this year I and the whole government has asked much of the British people. More than any Prime Minister I believe has asked of the British people in peacetime. And I have to say that the public have responded magnificently and selflessly. Putting their lives on hold, bearing any burden, overcoming every obstacle and tolerating every disruption and inconvenience no matter how large or small or inconsistent Mr Speaker so that they can do the right thing by their fellow citizens. I wish that it had been enough to defeat this Autumn surge. But while I am more optimistic now, more optimistic about the medium and long-term future than I have been for many months, there can be no doubt that the situation before us today is grave, and the need for action acute. It is absolutely right for this House – for members on all sides of this House- to have the doubts that have been expressed, to seek answers from me and to provide scrutiny. That is the purpose and duty of the House of Commons. But, while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy. So now is the time for us to put our differences aside and focus on the next four weeks, getting this virus back to its box. And I know that, once again, our amazing country will respond to adversity by doing what is right – staying at home, protecting the NHS, and saving lives. And in that spirit, I commend these regulations to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker with your permission, I will make a statement on the measures we must now take to contain the autumn surge of Coronavirus, protect our NHS and save lives. On Saturday evening the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser described the remorseless advance of this second wave. The extraordinary efforts being made by millions of people across the country especially by those in very high alert areas have made a real difference, suppressing the R rate below where it would otherwise have been. But the R is still above one in every part of England as it is across much of Europe and the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario. There are already more Covid patients in some hospitals now than at the height of the first wave, 2,000 more this Sunday than last Sunday. While the prevalence of the virus is worse in parts of the North, the doubling time in the South East and the Midlands is now faster than in the North West. Even in the South West, where incidence remains low, current projections mean they will start to run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks. And the modelling presented by our scientists suggests that without action, we could see up to twice as many deaths over the winter as we saw in the first wave. Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level. I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership. And I reject any idea that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners. In fact, we are moving to national measures when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were in France. We are engaged in a constant struggle to protect lives and livelihoods, and we must balance the restrictions we introduce against the long term scars they leave, whether for businesses and jobs, or our physical and mental health. No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential, so it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions, sometimes for months on end. I want to thank them, and to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. And we will continue as far as possible to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead. But we are fighting a disease Mr Speaker, and when the data changes course, we must change course too. To those in this House who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face. If we allow our health system to be overwhelmed – exactly as the data now suggests – then that would not only be a disaster for thousands of Covid patients, because their survival rates would fall, we would also reach a point where the NHS was no longer there for everyone. The sick would be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals. That sacred principle - of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – could be broken for the first time in our lives. Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die. And this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, but from not focusing enough. If we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would deprive others of the care they need. Cancer treatment, heart surgery, other life-saving procedures: all this could be put at risk if we do not get the virus under control. And even though we are so much better prepared than before, with stockpiles of PPE and ventilators, the Nightingales on standby, and 13,000 more nurses than last year, I am afraid the virus is doubling faster than we could ever conceivably add capacity. Even if we doubled capacity, the gain would be consumed in a single doubling of the virus. And so on Wednesday the House will vote on regulations which, if passed, will mean that from Thursday until 2nd December, in England, people will only be permitted to leave home for specific reasons, including: 
For education;
For work, if you cannot work from home;
For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own, or with one person from another household or support bubble;
For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury and harm;
To shop for food and essentials
And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer.

Essential shops will remain open and click and collect services will continue, so people do not need to stock up. But I am afraid that non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues and the personal care sector will all be closed. Hospitality must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Places of worship can open for individual prayer, funerals and formal childcare but sadly not for services. However Remembrance Sunday events can go ahead, provided they are held outside, and observe social distancing. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in construction or manufacturing. Elite sport will also be able to continue. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. The clinically vulnerable and those over 60 should minimise their contact with others. And while we will not ask people to shield again in the same way, the clinically extremely vulnerable should only work from home. Mr Speaker, I am truly sorry for the anguish these measures will impose, particularly for businesses which had just got back on their feet, businesses across the country who have gone to such trouble to make themselves Covid secure, to install Perspex screens, to do the right thing. Each of these actions has helped to bring the R down, and their hard work and your hard work will stand them in good stead, but for now it is clear that we must do more together. So the government will continue to do everything possible to support jobs and livelihoods in the next four weeks as we have throughout. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13.7 billion to help the self-employed, and I can announce today that for November we will double our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will also extend the deadline for applications to Covid loan schemes from the end of this month to the end of next to ensure that small businesses can access additional loans if required. We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April, and there are ways in which these measures are less prohibitive. We have for instance a moral duty to keep schools open now that it is safe to do so, because we must not allow this virus to damage our children’s futures. So schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings - and I am pleased this will command support Mr Speaker across the House. It is also vital that we continue provision for non-Covid healthcare so people should turn up to use the NHS, to get their scans, turn up for appointments and collect their treatments. Mr Speaker let me stress that these restrictions are time limited. After four weeks, on Wednesday 2nd December, they will expire and we intend to return to a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends, and the House will have a vote to agree the way forward. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and will continue to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. And while scientists are bleak in their predictions over the short-term, they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and long-term. And if the House asks me Mr Speaker what is the exit strategy, what is the way out – let me be as clear as I can: it is to get the R down now – to beat this autumn surge and to use this moment to exploit the medical and technical advances we are making to keep it low. We now have not only much better medication and the prospect of a vaccine the immediate prospect of many millions of cheap, reliable and rapid turnaround tests – with a result in minutes. Trials have already shown that we can help suppress the disease in hospitals, schools and universities by testing large numbers of NHS workers, children, teachers and students. These tests, crucially, identify people who are infectious but do not have symptoms, allowing them immediately to self-isolate and stop the spread of the disease, and allowing those who are not infectious to continue as normal. This means that, unlike in the spring, it’s possible to keep these institutions open and still stop the spread of the disease. And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests which we will be manufacturing in this country applying them in an ever-growing number of situations, from helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth, to testing whole towns and even cities. The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days. Mr Speaker, we have dexamethasone – the first validated life-saving treatment for the disease, pioneered in this country. We have the real prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year and we have ever more sophisticated means of providing virtually instant tests. I believe that these technical developments, taken together, will enable us to defeat this virus by the spring, as humanity has defeated every other infectious disease. And I am not alone in this optimism but I cannot pretend that the way ahead is easy, or without painful choices for us all. And so for the next four weeks I must ask the people of this country to come together, to protect the NHS, and to save many thousands of lives. And Mr Speaker I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Good evening and apologies for disturbing your Saturday evening with more news of Covid and I can assure you I wouldn’t do it unless it was absolutely necessary. First I will hand over to Chris and then Patrick who will present the latest data. 
Data Presentation 
Thank you very much Patrick, and Chris. I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures. When I told you two weeks ago that we were pursuing a local and a regional approach to tackling this virus, I believed then and I still believe passionately that it was the right thing to do. Because we know the cost of these restrictions, the damage they do, the impact on jobs, and on livelihoods, and on people’s mental health. No one wants to be imposing these kinds of measures anywhere. We didn’t want to be shutting businesses, pubs and restaurants in one part of the country, where incidence was very low, when the vast bulk of infections were taking place elsewhere. Our hope was that by strong local action, strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down where the disease was surging, and address the problem thereby across the whole country. And I want to thank the millions of people who have been putting up with these restrictions in their areas for so long. I want to thank local leaders who have stepped up and local communities. Because as you can see from some of those charts, the R has been kept lower than it would otherwise have been, and there are signs that your work has been paying off And we will continue as far as we possibly can to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead But as we’ve also seen from those charts, we’ve got to be humble in the face of nature And in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisers Whose models as you’ve just seen now suggest that unless we act we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day A peak of mortality alas far bigger than the one we saw in April Even in the South West, where incidence was so low, and still is so low, it is now clear that current projections mean they will run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks unless we act. And let me explain why the overrunning of the NHS would be a medical and moral disaster beyond the raw loss of life Because the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat Who would get oxygen and who wouldn’t Who would live and who would die, And doctors and nurses would be forced to choose between saving covid patients and non-covid patients And the sheer weight of covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of non-covid patients of the care they need It is crucial to grasp this that the general threat to public health comes not from focusing too much on covid, but from not focusing enough, from failing to get it under control And if we let the lines on those graphs grow in the way they could and in the way they’re projected to grow, then the risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families And even if I could now double capacity overnight – and obviously I am proud that we have massively increased capacity, we do have the Nightingales, we’ve got 13,000 more nurses now than last year, we have many more doctors – but it still would not be enough, because the virus is doubling faster than we could conceivably add capacity And so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative. From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home. You may only leave home for specific reasons, including: For education;
For work, say if you cannot work from home;
For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household;
For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm;
To shop for food and essentials;
And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer. I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up. Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. If you are clinically vulnerable, or over the age of 60, you should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others. I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way again. However we are asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to minimise their contact with others, and not to go to work if they are unable to work from home. I am under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure hardship this year. I am truly, truly sorry for that. This is why we are also going to extend the furlough system through November. The furlough scheme was a success in the spring. It supported people and businesses in a critical time. We will not end it. We will extend it until December. There will be some differences compared to March. These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together. My priority, our priority, remains keeping people in education - so childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will all remain open. Our senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be. We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures even more than it has already. I urge parents to continue taking their children to school and I am extremely grateful to teachers across the country for their dedication in enabling schools to remain open. And it is vital that we will keep provision for non-Covid healthcare groups going. So please - this is really important - unless your clinicians tell you otherwise, you should continue to use the NHS, get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments. If at all possible, we want you to continue to access these services, now and through the winter. Indeed it’s only by taking this action that we can protect the NHS for you. On Monday I will set out our plans to parliament. On Wednesday, parliament will debate and vote on these measures which, if passed, will as I say come into force on Thursday. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. We should remember we are not alone in what we’re going through. Our friends in Belgium, France and Germany have had to take very similar action. So as we come together now to fight this second wave, I want to say something about the way ahead Because people will reasonably ask when will this all end And as I have said before I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests Tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes And we know from trial across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the disease And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests Applying them in an ever-growing number of situations From helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth to testing whole towns and even whole cities The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days Working with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spread And I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options But they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long term future We will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surge We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April It is less prohibitive and less restrictive But from Thursday the basic message is the same Stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 22 October I am very glad to be joined today not just by Sir Patrick Vallance but by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak who is going to tell us more in a moment about our latest package to help this country in its battle with Covid. And I want to thank Rishi for measures that will protect people’s livelihoods and protect jobs and which will help us to deliver our overwhelming objective of getting the virus under control while keeping pupils in education and keeping the UK economy moving forward. I know that there are some people who will say that this economic objective is so important that we should stop all measures to control the virus and stop restrictions of any kind on our social lives or on the way we run our businesses. We can’t do that because alas the maths is inescapable. We would face many thousands more deaths. And no, to answer one commonly posed question, we would not be able to insulate the elderly and the vulnerable. Not in a society with so many multigenerational households. No country has been able to do that. And an uncontrolled expansion in the number of Covid patients would mean that the NHS would have even less capacity to treat heart patients and cancer patients and to deal with all our other medical needs. So that’s why we reject that extreme laissez-faire approach. And then there are others who say on the contrary that we need now to lock the whole place down from John O’ Groats to Lands’ End. Turn the lights out, shut up shop. Close schools and universities and go back to the same kind of lockdown we had in March and April and May. And I have to say I don’t believe that is the right course now. Not when the psychological cost of lockdown is well known to us and the economic cost. Not when it is being suggested that we might have to perform the same brutal lockdown again and again in the months ahead. And not when there is such obvious variation – unlike last time – between different parts of the country. So that’s why we are going for a balanced approach. A middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus. A regional and local approach - the same approach that is now being followed by some of the countries that are the most successful in their fights against the virus. And so to all those who are enduring these restrictions, and who have been enduring them for so long in all parts of the country. I want to repeat my thanks, for your bravery, for your patience and your public spiritedness. And I repeat – there are clear signs that our collective actions are working. Yes the R is above one, but thanks to the efforts of people of all ages in following the guidance and the rules the R is about half its natural rate. And if we follow the guidance together and follow the rules then we can get it down. And it is precisely because these measures are burdensome that from the beginning this government has provided unprecedented support to everyone in this country –  support worth £200bn to look after jobs and livelihoods and business. And as we adjust our campaign to fight the virus it is right that we should now produce a new package of support across the country in addition to the specific agreements we have reached with Lancashire, Merseyside and others. And because it is far, far better to keep business going now rather than to let those jobs go forever in a new national lockdown. We will win this fight against Covid. Because we can see that treatments are getting better, and medicines are getting better and testing technologies are getting better. And we have shown before that we can drive the R down. And in the meantime we need to protect jobs, protect livelihoods, and put the UK in strongest position for an economic recovery. I am now going to hand over to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. 

Boris:


It’s great to be back in Warsaw, thank you again Mateusz for your characteristically warm welcome. The reason I’m here is because Poland is absolutely critical to our collective European security and the lesson of the last 100 years is that when Poland is threatened with instability, or aggression on the borders of Poland, then we are all threatened and we’re all affected. And I just want to be absolutely clear, when Poland is threatened then the UK stands ready to help, as indeed Poland has always stood ready to help the United Kingdom. So I’m very pleased again to have the chance to talk to you Mateusz, you’re absolutely right in what you said. Much of what we talked about in November has come to pass and that’s why earlier today the UK’s 45 Commando Unit touched down in Poland. And those 350 troops join the 150 British troops who arrived here in December in response to instability on the Belarusian border, and the 150 British troops who contribute to NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence, are standing shoulder to shoulder with our Polish counterparts to bring stability and security not just to Poland, but to Europe and I would say to the world. I’ve just come from seeing Jens Soltenburg in NATO, where the message I have given, and the one the UK has been giving to all our counterparts, is that we need to work together now to achieve de-escalation and to persuade Vladimir Putin to de-escalate and to disengage. And as we tirelessly pursue the path of diplomacy to bring an end to the tensions on Ukrainian borders, it is important to remember why we are doing this and why we’re putting together this package of sanctions against a possible invasion, why we’re doing so much to support and protect Ukraine. And it’s exactly as Mateusz has just said - we won’t accept, Poland and the UK won’t accept, a world in which a powerful neighbour can bully or attack their neighbours. And we won’t accept it because we believe all people – no matter where they are born – have a right to live safely, choose who governs them and to decide what organisations they aspire to have membership of. Or, indeed, what bodies they want to cease being members of. And we will not compromise on that principle. It’s now more than 80 years Mateusz since Polish pilots came to my own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in West London to help my country in our fight for freedom. We stood side by side to uphold our values and our principles then, and we stand side by side today. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Previous waves of the pandemic did not have a single day with more than 100,000 new cases reported. On one day last week we had 200,000 people test positive. And the latest figure today is another 218,000, though that includes some delayed reports. So anyone who thinks our battle with Covid is over is, I’m afraid, profoundly wrong. This is a moment for the utmost caution. But our position today differs from previous waves in two crucial respects. First, we now know that Omicron is milder than previous variants, so while hospital admissions are rising quickly with over 15,000 Covid patients now in hospital in England alone - this is not yet, thankfully, translating into the same numbers needing intensive care that we saw in previous waves. And second, thanks to the fantastic national effort to get Britain boosted, we now have a substantial level of protection, higher than any of our European neighbours, with over 34 million boosters administered, including in England reaching more than 90 per cent of the over-70s, and 86 per cent of the over-50s. And so together with the Plan B measures that we introduced before Christmas, we have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again. We can keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus. But the weeks ahead are going to be challenging, both here in the UK and across the world. There is no escaping the fact that some services will be disrupted by staff absences, but we have been working through Christmas to prepare for this wherever possible. And if we all play our part in containing the spread of this virus the disruptions we face can be far less severe than a national lockdown, with all the devastation that would bring for livelihoods and the life chances of our children. So the government is acting to protect critical national services, keep supply chains open, and fortify our NHS to withstand the pressures ahead. We’ve identified 100,000 critical workers, in areas from food processing to transport to our border force - and from 10 January we’ll be rolling out lateral flow testing for all these workers, available on every working day. We’ll be sending testing kits directly to these organisations and liaising with them on the logistics. We’ve asked qualified teachers who have left the profession to come back and help fill temporary absences, and I want to thank them and all teachers, parents and pupils for taking the precaution to test yourselves and to wear a mask in the classroom, enabling vital face-to-face education to continue. We’re increasing NHS capacity by building onsite Nightingale hospitals, as well as creating 2,500 virtual beds where people can be safely treated at home. We’ve bought more antivirals per person than anywhere else in Europe those are the tablets which reduce your chances of going to hospital once you’ve caught Covid. We’re mobilising our volunteers – the emerging territorial army of the NHS – and we’re working to identify those NHS Trusts which are most likely to need actual military support, so this can be prepared now. As our NHS moves to a war footing, I will be recommending to Cabinet tomorrow that we continue with Plan B, because the public have responded and changed their behaviour, your behaviour, buying valuable time to get boosters in arms and help the NHS to cope with the Omicron wave. So please carry on observing those measures for now. Work from home if you can. Wear face coverings on public transport and in indoor public places, and take a test before you go to a high-risk venue or meet those who are elderly or vulnerable. And follow the relevant rules if you live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Above all, if you haven’t already done so please, please get that booster. Since I launched the Get Boosted Now campaign on 12 December: we have delivered 10 million extra boosters across the UK; we have doubled the rate of vaccination from 450,000 doses a day to a peak of more than 900,000; we matched the NHS’s previous record day, and then beat it again and again; and we met our target of offering a booster to every eligible adult a whole month early. The freedoms we are able to maintain in the teeth of this Omicron wave have been made possible by the number of people getting boosted, and I want to thank again, everyone who assisted this extraordinary national effort over Christmas. Our GPs and their teams, pharmacists and everyone in our fantastic NHS, the thousands of volunteers, the ingenious initiatives of local communities, like the one in Redbridge Town Hall which vaccinated 1,700 people on Christmas Day - and every one of you who has come forward and done your bit by getting jabbed. But there are still almost 9 million people eligible, who haven’t had their booster, And it’s absolutely heart-breaking that as many as 90 per cent of those in intensive care with Covid have not had their booster, and over 60 per cent of those in Intensive Care, who have Covid, have not had any vaccination at all. People are dying needlessly because they haven’t had their jabs, they haven’t had that booster. And there are 2 million booster slots available this week alone. It’s already the case that to travel to some countries you need a booster to be considered fully vaccinated, and it’s likely that within weeks this will increasingly become the norm. So if you haven’t done it already, get yourself boosted this month. Exactly a year after the UK administered the first AstraZeneca vaccine, a British invention that has enabled 2.5 billion jabs around the world - the best way to contain this virus, help our NHS, and keep our country open, is to get boosted, and so please, Get Boosted Now. 

Boris:


When NATO was founded more than 75 years ago, its members made a commitment to collective security that was unlike anything in previous history. And when the Berlin Wall fell the people of Europe made it clear they wanted a future where their freedom and their security are inextricably tied together. That is why NATO agreed that any country should be free to pursue the security alliances that it, that country chose. And we must resist, we must oppose any return to the days when the fates of nations are decided over their heads by a handful of great powers. And I want to stress this is not just about Russia, just as NATO itself is not just about Russia, of course not. This is about upholding the founding principles of an alliance which, perhaps more than any other institution, has brought stability and peace, prosperity to the world. And that must be the bedrock of our diplomatic efforts. The UK’s commitment to European security is unconditional and immovable. We have the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO. We have contributed more troops than any other ally to NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence. And today I have agreed with the Secretary General a package of support to strengthen further our collective security, sending troops, planes and ships to defend NATO from north to south. Earlier this week I met the Prime Minister of Lithuania and I will be travelling shortly to Poland. And these are the countries where every day the population wakes up with an acute awareness of the threat just across their border. And they are countries whose voices and views must be at the heart of every discussion we have. Because I believe that if we can keep a strong grip on the fundamentals, those fundamental principles that define our alliance and combine strong deterrence with patient diplomacy, then we can find our way through this crisis. But the stakes are very high and this is a very dangerous moment. And at stake are the rules that protect every nation, every nation – big and small. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Great to be here in Tyneside, the number one exporting region of the UK. Great to be with the CBI. And I want to begin with a massive thank you to British business. For keeping going. For looking after your employees. For rising to the challenge. For responding to the call for ventilators in those first dark days. Dozens of you, Kitchen appliance makers, Hairdryer makers, Formula one motor car manufacturers, Turning your production lines over in days to try to save lives. For making the masks and the gowns and the gloves at such speed. Turning things round from that awful moment when we realised we simply didn’t have the domestic production. So we have gone from being able to supply 1 per cent of our domestic needs to 80 per cent. And thank you British industry, enterprise, commerce, For producing not just one but perhaps half a dozen vaccines. Because without you, let’s face it, we would simply not be here, And nor would tens of thousands of people in our country and millions around the world, Who owe their lives to your resourcefulness and inventiveness. And while I’m on the subject, can I ask who has had your booster? You all look far too young and thrusting to need a booster but get your booster as soon as you can. Because it is by vaccinating our country that we have been able to get your staff back to their place of work, to open our theatres, our restaurants and to get back for longer now than any other comparator country to something like normal life. Even if we are still bumping elbows and wearing masks. I am not going to pretend that everything is going to be plain sailing. We can see the state of the pandemic abroad. The supply chain issues that we’re facing. The pressure on energy prices that we’re all facing. The skills shortages. But don’t forget folks, my friends, it was only last year they were saying we would have an unemployment crisis now on the scale not seen since the 1980s or 1990s. They were forecasting 12 per cent unemployment. And what have we got? Thanks to you, thanks to the resilience of British business, we have employment back in work at pre-pandemic levels. It was only last year that we experienced the biggest fall in output in a century. As we were forced to lock down the economy. Well look at us now. Thanks to you and thanks to British business bouncebackability, we are forecast to have the fastest economic growth in the G7. And I was there in the 70s and 80s and 90s. And I remember mass unemployment. And the misery and the drain of the human spirit. And I would much rather have our problems today – which are fundamentally caused by a return in global confidence and a surge in demand. Because now we have a massive opportunity to fix these supply-side problems. To transform whole sectors of our economy and to tackle the chronic problems underlying the UK economy. The woeful imbalance in productivity across the country. But also the imbalance between British business. Between the go-getting world-beaters represented by so many people in this room, And the long comet tail whose potential is frankly yet to be realised. That don’t have the skills – particularly the IT skills – as Rishi the Chancellor so often points out. That don’t have the banks behind them, that don’t have the investment. And that is the mission of this country – to unite and level up. Of this government – to unite and level up across the whole country. And I’ve got to be honest with you, it is a moral mission. As you get older, the funny thing is you get more idealistic and less cynical. It’s a moral thing, but it is also an economic imperative. Because if this country could achieve the same kind of geographical balance and dispersion of growth and wealth that you find in most of our most successful economic comparators, And if all our businesses could reach more balance in their levels of productivity, Then there would be absolutely no stopping us. And we would achieve what I believe we can. And become the biggest and most successful economy in Europe. And today fate has handed us an opportunity to do that. When the first industrial revolution began 250 years ago it was British industry that had first-mover advantage. For hundreds of years, we maintained that pace. Right up until the beginning of the 20th century we were producing more coal, smelting more iron, building more ships and boilers and making more machines than virtually any other country on earth. And today we are on the brink of another revolution. A green industrial revolution. And again there are many ways in which we have first-mover advantage. And today I want to tell you in the CBI how Britain is going to win in the new green industrial revolution. Provided we act and act now. I have had some pretty wonderful jobs in my life, but among the most purely hedonistic I would rank motoring correspondent of GQ magazine. I drove: 
Ferraris
Maseratis
Nissan Skylines
Proton Sagas

You name it, I drove it. And I learned to admire the incredible diversity of the UK specialist motor manufacturing sector, which is actually the biggest in the world. And I have spent hours in the traffic, listening to the porridge-like burble and pop of the biggest and most sophisticated internal combustion engines ever made. And I have heard that burble turn into an operatic roar as I have put my foot down and burned away from the lights at speeds I would not now confess to my protection officers. In that time, that great era, I only tried two EVs – electric vehicles. An extraordinary wheeled rabbit hutch that was so tiny you could park it sideways. And I tried the first Tesla for sale in this country, for GQ, that expired in the fast lane of the M40. They’ve got a lot better. And when a few years later as Mayor of London I tried to get London motorists to go electric and we put in charging points around the city, I must confess that they were not then a soaraway success. And they stood forlorn like some piece of unused outdoor gym equipment. But ten years after that – the tipping point has come, hasn’t it? UK sales of EVs are now increasing at 70 per cent a year. And in 2030 we are ending the market for new hydrocarbon ICEs, ahead of other European countries. And companies are responding. Here in the north east, Nissan has decided to make an enormous bet on new electric vehicles and together with Envision there is now a massive new gigafactory for batteries. And around the world, these cars are getting ever more affordable. And at Glasgow two weeks ago the tipping point came, as motor manufacturers representing a third of the world market – including the EU and America – announced that they would go electric by 2035. And of course, Glasgow was far bigger and more important than that. 250 years after we launched the first industrial revolution, we are showing the world how to power past coal. When I was a kid, 80 per cent of our electricity came from coal. And I remember those huge barges taking coal up the Thames to Battersea power station and those four chimneys belching fumes into the face and lungs of the city. By the time I became mayor, Battersea was a wreck. Closed for being simply too polluting. And good for nothing except the final shoot out in gangster movies. But in 2012, we were still 40 per cent dependent on coal. Today – only ten years later – coal supplies less than 2 per cent of our power. And by 2024 it will be down to zero And Battersea of course is a great funkapolitan hive of cafes and restaurants and hotels and homes Thanks to the vision of the former Mayor. And every time I made that point to leaders in Glasgow, About the speed of the switch that we’ve made from coal, I could see them thinking about it and I could see them thinking: right, ok, maybe this is doable. And when I was a kid literally zero per cent of our energy came from wind. And it seemed faddish and ludicrous to imagine that we could light and heat our homes with a technology that dated from 9th century Persia, I think. And yet today – look at the coast of the north east where we are today. Row after row stretching out to the north sea, of beautiful white mills as we claim a new harvest, Rich and green from the drowned meadows of doggerland. And on some days we derive almost half this country’s energy needs, With the biggest offshore wind production anywhere in the world – and growing the whole time. And that tipping point having been reached, the pace of change is now going to accelerate like new a Tesla. Because I can tell you as a former motoring correspondent, EVs may not burble like sucking doves, and
they may not have that arum arum araaaaaagh that you love, But they have so much torque that they move off the lights faster than a Ferrari. And we are now embarked on a new epoch. And in just a few years’ time, after almost a century of using roughly the same technology, we are going to change radically. We are going to change radically: 
our cars
our trucks
our buses
our ships
our boats
our planes
our trains
our domestic heating systems
our farming methods
our industrial processes
our power generation

And much else besides. And I can tell you the force driving that change. It won’t be government, and it won’t even be business – though business and government together will have a massive influence. It will be the consumer. It will be the young people of today, The disciples of David Attenborough, Not just in this country but around the world, Who can see the consequences of climate change and who will be demanding better from us. And I confidently predict that in just a few years’ time it will be as noisome, offensive to the global consumer to open a new coal fired power station as it is to get on a plane and light up a cigar. And as the world reaches this pivotal moment, post Glasgow, it’s vital that we recognise not just the scale of the challenge, but the opportunity now for British business and industry. Because in the end it is you, it is business people, who will fix this problem. Governments don’t innovate. Governments don’t produce new products and get out and sell them in the market place. And though governments can sell, governments can spend tens if not hundreds of billions, We know that the market has hundreds of trillions. And yet we also know that government has a vital role in making that market, and in framing the right regulation. And to ensure that you, the British business succeeds in this new world, we have set out a ten point plan for government leadership. A new Decalogue that I produced exactly a year ago, when I came down from Sinai and I said to my officials the new ten commandments thou shalt develop: Offshore wind. Hydrogen. Nuclear power. Zero emission vehicles. Green public transport, cycling and walking. ‘Jet zero’ and green ships 7: greener buildings 8: carbon capture and storage 9: nature and trees 10: green finance And for each of those objectives we are producing a roadmap, so that you in the private sector can see the opportunities ahead and what you need to do. And we are regulating so as to require new homes and buildings to have EV charging points – with another 145,000 charging points to be installed thanks to these regulations. We are investing in new projects to turn wind power into hydrogen. And the net zero strategy is expected to trigger about £90 billion of private sector investment, driving the creation of high wage high skill jobs across the UK, as part of our mission to unite and level up across the country. Not just in the green industrial revolution of course, but in all sectors of the economy. And to help you, and to build the platform, to give you the advantage you need, we are now waging a cross-Whitehall campaign to solve our productivity puzzle and to rebalance our lopsided economy. Fixing our infrastructure with investment on a scale not seen since the Victorians. And we must begin with energy and power generation, if we are going to have, allow, our manufacturing industry to succeed, we must end the unfairness that UK, high energy-intensive manufacturing pays so much more than our competitors overseas. And that’s why we are going to address the cost of our nuclear power and we are all now paying for the historic under under-investment in nuclear power. Which country first split the atom? Which country had the first civilian nuclear power plant? It was this one. And why have we allowed ourselves to be left behind? Well, you tell me. So we are investing not just in big new nuclear plants but in small nuclear reactors as well. And we are consulting on classifying this essential technology as “green investment”, so that we can get more investment flowing in and ahead of the EU. Lenin once said that the communist revolution was soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country. Well, I hesitate to quote Lenin, Tony, before the CBI, but the coming industrial revolution is green power plus the electrification of the whole country. We are electrifying our cars, we are electrifying our rail. Last week we announced three vast new high speed lines. Cutting the time from London to Manchester by an hour. And creating a new Crossrail of the north Cutting the time from Manchester to Leeds from 55 to 33 minutes. A crossrail for the Midlands, Cutting journey times from Birmingham to Nottingham from one hour and 14 minutes to 26 minutes. But these plans are far richer and more ambitious than some of the coverage has perhaps suggested. To solve this country’s transport problems, you can’t just endlessly carve your way through virgin countryside. You have to upgrade, and to electrify. You have to use the tracks that already exist and bring them back into service. And we are doing the Beeching reversals – that’s putting in lines that were taken out sadly in the last century. You have to put other transport networks as well. You have to put in clean buses, you have to improve, 4000 new clean green buses we’re putting in. And of course, you have to fix the roads as well. We cannot be endlessly hostile to road improvements. And we have to do it now, we have to fix it now. I know that there are some people who think that working habits have been remade by the pandemic, and that everyone will be working only on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, in an acronym I won’t repeat. I don’t want to be dogmatic about this, but I have my doubts. And it is not just that young people need to be in the office to learn, and to compete, and to pick up social capital. There are also sound evolutionary reasons why mother nature does not like working from home. So I people prophesy that people will come back, Tony – they will come to the office. And they will come back on the roads and the rail. But people also want choice. And that is why we must put in the gigabit broadband – as we are – which has gone up massively just in the last couple of years from 7 per cent when I became PM to 65 per cent at the beginning of next year. And with safer streets, With great local schools, With fantastic broadband, People will have the confidence to stay nearer the place they grew up. To start business. And business will have the confidence to invest. And then of course there is one thing that business wants and that this country needs, Far more than a hundred supersonic rail links, Far more than broadband, And that is skills. And the people that you all need to staff your business. It’s an astonishing fact that the 16-18 year olds in this country are getting 40% less time and instruction than our competitors in the OECD, and so we’re turning that round. We are focusing on skills, skills, skills, Investing in our FE colleges, our apprentices, in the knowhow and confidence of young people. And since, as everybody knows, 80 per cent of the 2030 workforce are already in work, We are giving every adult who needs it the chance to get a level three skill. £3000 for a lifetime skills guarantee. We are supporting bootcamps for everything from IT to entrepreneurship. And at this pivotal moment in our economic history, we are taking advantage of our new freedoms. To deliver freeports as well as free trade deals. And to regulate differently and better, To lengthen our lead in all the amazing new technologies of the 21st century: 
AI
cyber
quantum computing

And all the rest and all the applications of those technologies to the areas in which we excel. So you get fin tech, ed tech, bio tech, med tech, nano tech, ag tech, green tech, So you sound basically like 15th century Mexico. And that is what this country is doing There are only 3 countries that have produced more than 100 tech unicorns and they are, as you will know, well which are they? Let’s see who’s been paying attention to any of my speeches in the last few … which 3 nations have produced more than 100 tech unicorns? Correct. They are the US, China and the UK And the wonderful thing about the more than the 100 tech unicorns is they are dispersed now far more evenly across the whole of the UK than the tech unicorns of some of our rival competitor economies. And that is a fantastic thing. We want to see the dispersal of this growth and development across the UK. That’s why this government has doubled investment in scientific research – and again, we want to see the benefits of that research across the whole of the country But in the end And this is the most important message of all. There are limits to what governments can do. And I just want to be absolutely clear about this – because this has been an extraordinary period. There has been the financial crisis of 2008, where government had to intervene on a massive scale. Then Covid, when government had to intervene on a massive scale. But government cannot fix everything and government sometimes should get out of your hair. And government should make sure there is less regulation and indeed less taxation. And the true driver of growth is not government, it is the energy and dynamism and originality of the private sector And Tony, yesterday, I went as we all must to Peppa Pig World. Hands up if you’ve been to Peppa Pig World – [not enough] I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. It had very safe streets. Discipline in schools. Heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems, I noticed. Even if they are a bit stereotypical about daddy pig. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer, or possibly a sort of Picasso-like hairdryer, A pig that was rejected by the BBC, Would now be exported to 180 countries, With theme parks both in America and in China as well as in the New Forest, And a business that is worth at least £6bn to this country, £6bn and counting. I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? No government in the world, no Whitehall civil servant in the world, could conceivably have come up with Peppa. So my final message to you. As we stand on the brink of this green industrial revolution. As we prepare to use our new regulatory freedoms in what I believe will be a very strong post-Covid rebound. We are blessed, We are blessed not just with capital markets and the world’s best universities and incredible pools of liquidity in London, the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, We are also blessed with the amazing inventive power and range of British business. And that above all is what fills me with confidence, members of the CBI, for the days ahead. Thank you very much for your kind attention this morning, thank you. 

Boris:


Standing on a Cornish beach with President Macron last summer, one could not help but be struck by the majesty of the ocean before us, and its importance to all our lives. Because the nations of the world are not separated by seas and oceans – we are bound together by them. Whatever our stage of development, whatever our system of government, the same briny waters lap at all our shores. And we all have a duty to help them thrive. It’s a duty the UK takes extremely seriously. It’s why we’ve committed half a billion pounds to help developing nations protect their seas and coasts. Why we’ve thrown a Blue Belt around 2.5 million square miles of ocean. And why, I can announce today, the UK will be joining the High Ambition Coalition on Biodiversity beyond National Jurisdiction. Because it’s vital that we all step up and meet our obligations to the marine environment under the Convention on the Law of the Sea. And that won’t happen unless we agree a treaty to protect the vast expanse of water – something like 60 per cent of it – that falls beyond the borders of any one nation. At COP26, I stressed the need for the world to raise its ambitions with respect to our oceans. So I’m delighted that President Macron has convened this summit. And I hope it kicks off a year in which the world comes together in support of the seas that surround us, the flora and fauna within, and everyone around the world whose livelihoods depend on thriving, clean, and sustainable oceans. 

Boris:


Thank you very much President Zelenskyy and thank you for welcoming us all to your Mariyinski palace here, it’s absolutely fantastic to be back in Kyiv and to see the excitement, the buzz of this capital which has changed a lot since I was last here five years ago, in many interesting and positive ways. But we have to face a grim reality which is that as we stand here today Volodmyr, more than 100,000 Russian troops are gathering on your border in perhaps the biggest demonstration of hostility towards Ukraine in our lifetimes. And the potential deployment dwarves the 30,000 troops Russia sent to invade Crimea in 2014. Since that time of course, as everybody knows, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed and Ukraine has been plunged into nearly a decade of war. It goes without saying that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a political disaster, a humanitarian disaster, in my view would also be, for Russia, for the world, a military disaster as well. And the potential invasion completely flies in the face of President Putin’s claims to be acting in the interest of the Ukrainian people. The UK and other countries will be judged, by the people of the Ukraine and the world, on how we respond and how we help. Since 2015 the UK has trained over 22,000 Ukrainian military personnel and provided £2.2 million worth of non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine. Two weeks ago we sent anti-tank weaponry to strengthen Ukraine’s defences further. Today I have announced a further £88 million of UK funding to support good governance and energy independence in Ukraine. This will bolster your efforts Volodmyr, and those of others to build a free and prosperous Ukrainian society, free of malign influences. Alongside other countries we are also preparing a package of sanctions and other measures to be enacted the moment the first Russian toe-cap crosses further into Ukrainian territory. And we have done all this and prepared all this, not as a show of hostility towards Russia, but as a demonstration that we will always stand up for freedom, democracy and Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of aggression. In recent days I have spoken to the leaders of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, the NATO Secretary General and others - all agree on the fundamental importance of supporting Ukraine’s self-determination. Because the people of Ukraine have the inalienable right to choose how they are governed and indeed which organisations they aspire to join. And as your friend and partner, the UK will always uphold that right. It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy and I believe that is still possible. We are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are, we have the sanctions ready, we’re providing military support and we will also intensify our economic co-operation. Because we are a firm and enduring ally of Ukraine and a supporter of Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and integrity. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I would like to make a statement. First I want to express my deepest gratitude to Sue Gray, and all the people who have contributed to this report, which I have placed in the Library of this House and the government has published in full today, for everyone to read. I will address its findings in this statement - but firstly I want to say: sorry. Sorry for the things we simply did not get right and sorry for the way that this matter has been handled. It is no use saying that this or that was within the rules. It is no use saying that people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone. We asked people across this country to make the most extraordinary sacrifices, not to meet loved ones, not to visit relatives before they died, and I understand the anger that people feel. But, Mr Speaker, it is not enough to say sorry. This is a moment when we must look at ourselves in the mirror and we must learn. And while the Metropolitan Police must yet complete their investigation - and that means there are no details of specific events in Sue Gray’s report - I, of course, accept Sue Gray’s general findings in full, and above all her recommendation that we must learn from these events and act now. With respect to the events under police investigation, she says - and I quote -  “No conclusions should be drawn, or inferences made from this other than it is now for the police to consider the relevant material in relation to those incidents.” But more broadly she finds that -  “There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.” That is why we are making changes now to the way Downing Street and the Cabinet Office run so that we can get on with the job, the job that I was elected to do and that this government was elected to do. First, it is time to sort out what Sue Gray rightly calls the “fragmented and complicated” leadership structures of Downing Street which she says have not evolved sufficiently to meet the demands of the expansion of Number ten. And we will do that, including by creating an Office of the Prime Minister, with a Permanent Secretary to lead Number ten. Second, Mr Speaker, it is clear from Sue Gray’s report that it is time not just to review the Civil Service and Special Adviser codes of conduct wherever necessary to ensure they take account of Sue Gray’s recommendations but also to make sure those codes are properly enforced. And third, I will be saying more in the coming days about the steps we will take to improve the Number ten operation and the work of the Cabinet Office to strengthen Cabinet Government and to improve the vital connection between Number ten and parliament. Mr Speaker, I get it and I will fix it. And I want to say to the people of this country. I know what the issue is, it is whether this government can be trusted to deliver and I say yes we can be trusted yes we can be trusted to deliver. We said we would deliver Brexit and we did. We are setting up freeports across the whole United Kingdom, I’ve been to one of them today, which is creating tens of thousands of new jobs Mr Speaker. We said we would get this country through Covid and we did, we delivered the fastest vaccine roll out in Europe and the fastest booster programme of any major economy so that we have been able to restore people’s freedoms faster than any comparable economy and at the same time as we have been cutting crime by fourteen per cent and building 40 new hospitals and rolling out gigabit broadband, and delivering on all the other promises of that 2019 agenda so that we have the fastest economic growth in the G7. We have shown that we can do things people thought were impossible and that we can deliver for the British people. The reason we are coming out of Covid so fast is at least partly because we doubled the speed of the booster rollout and I can tell the House and this country, that we are going to bring the same energy and commitment to getting on with the job to delivering for the British people and to our mission to unite and level up across the country. And I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s statement in the House of Commons on Ukraine Mr Speaker, A few weeks ago, I commissioned an independent inquiry into a series of events in Downing Steet, the Cabinet Office as well as some other Whitehall departments that may have constituted potential breaches of the Covid regulations. That process has quite properly involved sharing information continuously with the Metropolitan Police, so I welcome the Met’s decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters. But I want to reassure the House, Mr Speaker, and the country, that I and the whole government are focused one hundred percent on dealing with the people’s priorities including the UK’s leading role in protecting freedom around the world. And with permission, I will make a statement about the United Kingdom’s response to the situation in Ukraine.
This winter, we have witnessed a spectacle that we hoped had been banished from our continent: a large and powerful country massing troops and tanks on the border of a neighbour, with the obvious threat of invading.
Russia has, of course, already attacked Ukraine, illegally annexing 10,000 square miles of her territory in 2014 and igniting a war in the Donbas region, and Ukraine has scarcely known a day of peace ever since. Now she faces the danger of a renewed invasion and this time the force arrayed on her frontier comprises over 100,000 troops - far bigger than anything Russia has deployed against her before. If the worst happens and the destructive firepower of the Russian army were to engulf Ukraine’s towns and cities, I shudder to contemplate the tragedy that would ensue. Ukrainians have every moral and legal right to defend their country and I believe their resistance would be dogged and tenacious, and the bloodshed comparable to the first war in Chechnya, or Bosnia, Mr Speaker, or any other conflict that Europe has endured since 1945. No-one would gain from such a catastrophe. Russia would create a wasteland in a country which as she constantly reminds us, is composed of fellow Slavs; and Russia would never be able to call it peace. For months, Britain has worked in lockstep with the United States and our allies across Europe to avoid such a disaster. We’ve sought to combine dialogue with deterrence, emphasising how a united Western alliance would exact a forbidding price for any Russian incursion into Ukraine, including by imposing heavy economic sanctions, and at the same time we stand ready, as we always have, to address any legitimate Russian concerns through honest diplomacy. On 13th December, I spoke to President Putin, and I stressed that NATO had no thought of encircling or otherwise threatening his country and that Russia enjoyed as much right as any other state to live in peace and security.
But as I said to him, Ukraine of course enjoys an equal and symmetrical right to that of Russia. And I said any attack on his neighbour would be followed by tougher sanctions against Russia, further steps to help Ukraine defend herself, and by an increased NATO presence to protect our allies on NATOs eastern flank. The truth is that if Russia’s goal is to keep NATO forces away from her borders, then if that is Russia’s goal, then invading Ukraine could scarcely be more counter-productive. My Right Honourable Friends the Foreign and Defence Secretaries have both conveyed the same message to President Putin and I am prepared of course to speak, ready to speak to him again. Meanwhile, the American Deputy Secretary of State met her Russian counterpart in Geneva on 10th January and the NATO-Russia Council gathered two days later as the House knows. The American Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, met the Russian Foreign Minister last Friday, and the US Administration has confirmed President Biden’s willingness to have another meeting with President Putin, continuing the bilateral dialogue they began last year. But credible deterrence is the other side of the coin. Last night, I held a virtual meeting with President Biden, President Macron, Chancellor Scholz, President Duda, Prime Minister Draghi, Secretary General Stoltenberg, President Michel and President von der Leyen. We agreed that we would respond in unison to any Russian attack on Ukraine, in unison, by imposing coordinated and severe sanctions, heavier than anything we have done before against Russia. 
And we agreed on the necessity of finalising these measures as swiftly as possible, in order to maximise their deterrent effect.
We in the UK will not hesitate to toughen our national sanctions against Russia in response to whatever President Putin may do – and the House will soon hear more on this from my Right Honourable Friend the Foreign Secretary. We have already declassified compelling intelligence exposing Russian intent to install a puppet regime in Ukraine and we will continue to disclose any Russian use of cyber-attacks, false flag operations or disinformation. Amid all these pressures, Ukraine asks for nothing except to be allowed to live in peace and to seek her own alliances, as every sovereign country has a right to do. Last week, the UK acted to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to defend her soil by supplying anti-armour missiles and deploying a small training team of British personnel, in addition to the work of Operation Orbital, which as the House will know, has trained 21,000 Ukrainian troops since 2015. Yesterday, we took the responsible precaution of temporarily withdrawing some staff and dependants from the British Embassy in Kyiv. Though I emphasise that the Embassy remains open and will continue to provide consular assistance for British nationals in Ukraine, and I am particularly grateful for the dedication of our Ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons.
I commend our NATO allies for the steps they have taken and are taking to protect the eastern flank of the alliance.
Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic and deploying four F-16s to Lithuania to join NATO’s longstanding air policing mission. France has expressed its readiness to send troops to Romania under NATO command; and the United States has raised the alert level of 8,500 combat troops, preparing to deploy them in Europe at short notice. The British Army leads the NATO Battlegroup in Estonia and if Russia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new NATO deployments to protect our allies in Europe. In every contact with Russia, the UK and our allies have stressed our unity and our adherence to vital points of principle. We cannot bargain away the vision of a Europe whole and free that emerged in those amazing years from 1989 to 1991, healing the division of our continent by the Iron Curtain. We will not reopen that divide by agreeing to overturn the European security order because Russia has placed a gun to Ukraine’s head. Nor can we accept the doctrine - implicit in Russian proposals - that all states are sovereign, but some are more sovereign than others. The draft treaty published by Russia in December would divide our continent once again between free nations and countries whose foreign and defence policies are explicitly constrained by the Kremlin, in ways that Russia would never accept for herself. More than half of Europe - including a dozen or more members of NATO and of the European Union – would be only partially sovereign and required to seek the Kremlin’s approval before inviting any military personnel from NATO countries onto their soil. The Czech Republic – at the very heart of Europe, hundreds of miles from Russia - would have to ask the Kremlin for permission if she wanted to invite a company of German infantry to join an exercise, or even to help with flood defences. There is nothing new about large and powerful nations using the threat of brute force to terrify reasonable people into giving way to otherwise completely unacceptable demands. But if President Putin were to choose the path of bloodshed and destruction, he must realise that it would be both tragic and futile, and nor should we allow him to believe that he could easily take some smaller portion of Ukraine, to salami slice, because the resistance will be ferocious. Anyone who has been to Kyiv as I have and stood by the Wall of Remembrance and studied the portraits of nearly 4,500 Ukrainians who have died in defence of their country since 2014 - and the total death toll in excess of 14,000 – anyone who’s been there will know that Ukrainians are determined to fight and have become steadily more skilled at guerrilla warfare. And if Russia pursues this path, many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home. And the response in the international community would be the same and the pain that will be inflicted on the Russian economy will be the same. When I spoke to President Putin, I also reminded him that at crucial moments in history, Britain and Russia have stood together. The only reason why both our countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council is because of the heroism of Soviet soldiers in the struggle against fascism, side-by-side with ourselves. I believe that all of Russia’s fears could yet be allayed, and we could find a path to mutual security through patient and principled diplomacy, provided that President Putin avoids the trap of starting a terrible war, and Mr Speaker, a war that I believe would earn and deserve the condemnation of history and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Welcome to the Africa Investment Conference. A wonderful moment to be able to focus on the amazing opportunities in a spectacular continent, with vast resources and over a billion people. By 2050, Africa’s population is set to double to 2.5 billion and the mother continent of humanity will be home to a quarter of the world’s population. As that day approaches, Africa is transforming its fortunes by means of trade and investment and I want Britain to be with you every step of the journey. We’re already one of Africa’s biggest commercial partners - we’ve signed nine free trade agreements with our African friends, and in this financial year alone our embassies and high commissions helped British companies to invest £2.5 billion in Africa. But I am determined to do much more. Our shared task must be to ensure that Africa prospers from the green industrial revolution, that will rescue humanity from catastrophic climate change. The UK is already the biggest investor for instance in renewable energy in South Africa. Now we want to work alongside our African partners to build new and high-quality infrastructure according to the highest standards of transparency and environmental protection, which is why we’ve launched the Clean Green Initiative. We want to support African countries that are already suffering the effects of climate change, and one export guarantee from the British Government will allow 87 emergency bridges made in Gloucestershire to be used to strengthen flood defences in Ghana. We want to be Africa’s partner of choice and if we get this right, then free trade and investment will be the most formidable tools in our hands to generate economic growth and allow Africa to thrive. Thank you. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on our progress against Omicron and the review of our Plan B measures. Within hours of learning from scientists in South Africa about the emergence of a new Covid variant last November, this government acted, introducing balanced and proportionate restrictions at our borders to slow the seeding of Omicron in our country. As we learned more about this highly transmissible new variant, we implemented the Plan B measures we had prepared precisely in case our situation deteriorated, encouraging people to change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus and buying crucial time to get boosters into arms. We made the big call to refocus our National Health Service, necessarily requiring the difficult postponement of many other appointments – So that we could double the speed of booster programme. And thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our NHS and its volunteers, we delivered the fastest booster programme in Europe, reaching half our population before any other European country, with more than 36 million boosters now in arms across the UK, including more than 90 per cent of all over 60s in England. And taking a balanced approach, we resisted calls from others to shut down our country all over again. Many nations across Europe have endured further winter lockdowns. Many have seen hospitality curfews and nightclubs closed, capacity limits at sports stadiums, the return of social distancing, and, in some places, Christmas and New Year as good as cancelled. But this government took a different path. We kept England open. And we supported those businesses which faced reduced demand because of the response to Plan B measures. And while we must continue to remain cautious, the data are showing that time and again this government got the toughest decisions right. Today’s latest ONS data show clearly that infection levels are falling in England. And while there are some places where cases are likely to continue rising, including in primary schools – our scientists believe it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally. There remain, of course, significant pressures on the NHS across our country, and especially in the North East and North West. But hospital admissions which were doubling every 9 days just two weeks ago – have now stabilised, with admissions in London even falling. And the numbers in intensive care not only remain low but are actually also falling. So this morning, the Cabinet concluded that because of the extraordinary booster campaign together with the way the public have responded to the Plan B measures - we can return to Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire. As a result, from the start of Thursday next week mandatory certification will end. Organisations can, of course, choose to use the NHS Covid Pass voluntarily but we will end the compulsory use of Covid status certification in England. From now, the government is no longer asking people to work from home and people should now speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office. And having looked at the data carefully, the Cabinet concluded that once regulations lapse, the government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere. Mr Speaker, from tomorrow, we will no longer require face masks in classrooms, and the Department for Education will shortly remove national guidance on their use in communal areas. In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded places, particularly where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet. But we will trust the judgement of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one. The government will also ease further restrictions on visits to care homes and my Rt Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, will set out plans in the coming days. Mr Speaker, as we return to Plan A, the House will know that some measures still remain, including those on self-isolation. In particular, it is still a legal requirement for those who have tested positive for Covid to self-isolate. On Monday we reduced the isolation period to five full days with two negative tests. And there will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether - just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu. As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. The self-isolation regulations expire on 24th March, at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards. In advance of that, we will set out our long-term strategy for living with Covid-19, explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances – especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives. But to make that possible, we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. When there are still over 16,000 people in hospital in England alone, the pandemic is not over. And, Mr Speaker, make no mistake, Omicron is not a mild disease for everyone - and especially if you’re not vaccinated. Just look at the numbers in intensive care in other countries where vaccination rates are far lower. Indeed, from our NHS data, we know that around 90 per cent of people in intensive care are not boosted. So I urge members across the House to do everything possible to encourage any remaining constituents who have not done so – to get boosted now. And for the next few weeks, I encourage everyone across the country to continue with all the cautious behaviours that we know help to keep each everybody safe. washing hands, letting fresh air in, getting tested, self-isolating if positive, and, as I say, thinking about wearing a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings. Mr Speaker, Omicron has tested us, just as Alpha and Delta did before. But let’s remember some of what we’ve achieved. We were the first nation in the world to administer a vaccine. We were the fastest in Europe to roll it out. Because outside of the European Medicines Agency, this government made the big call to pursue our own British procurement strategy rather than opting back into the EU scheme as some people urged. We created a world-beating testing programme, the largest in Europe, and procured the most antivirals of any country in Europe too, because this government made the big call to invest early in lateral flow tests and in cutting-edge drugs to protect the most vulnerable. We’ve delivered the fastest booster campaign in Europe, and we’re the first to emerge from the Omicron wave, because the government made the big call to focus on our NHS, and to refocus our activity and lead that campaign to Get Boosted Now. And that’s why we’ve retained the most open economy and society anywhere across the European continent, and the fastest growing economy in the G7 - because we made that tough decision to open up last Summer when others said that we shouldn’t, and to keep things open this winter when others wanted them shut. This week the World Health Organisation said that while the global situation remains challenging, the United Kingdom can start to see “light at the end of the tunnel”. And Mr Speaker, this is no accident of history. Confronted by the nation’s biggest challenge since the Second World War and the worst pandemic since 1918, any government would get some things wrong. but this government got the big things right. And I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a Statement on the Omicron variant, and our measures to contain this virus, fortify our NHS and keep our country open. First, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to everyone working in our NHS and social care, for their extraordinary efforts in the teeth of yet another wave of this pandemic, and for all they have done, together with thousands of volunteers, to get Britain boosted. Since we began the Get Boosted Now campaign just over three weeks ago, we have delivered 10 million extra boosters across the UK;  we have doubled the rate of vaccination from 450,000 doses a day to a peak of more than 900,000; we have matched the NHS’s previous record day, and then beaten it again and again; and we have met our target of offering a booster to every eligible adult in England a whole month early. As a result, we have a higher level of booster protection than all our European neighbours, with over 34 million boosters administered across the UK, including in England reaching more than 90 per cent of the over-70s, and 86 per cent of the over-50s. Together with the evidence that Omicron causes less severe disease than previous variants, and the way the public have conscientiously changed their behaviour in response to Plan B, this level of protection means we are in a very different position than during previous waves. I know some Hon Members might therefore ask whether this means we can now do away with measures altogether. But I am sorry to report that hospital admissions are rising rapidly, doubling around every 9 days, with already more than 15,000 Covid patients in hospital in England alone. We are experiencing the fastest growth in Covid cases that we have ever known, with over 218,000 cases reported yesterday, although that included some delayed reporting. And potentially of greatest concern, case rates are now rapidly rising among the older and more vulnerable, including doubling every week among those over 60, with the obvious risk that this will continue to increase the pressures on our NHS. So in response to the latest data, the Cabinet agreed this morning that we should stick with Plan B for another three weeks, with a further review before the regulations expire on 26 January. People in England should carry on working from home whenever they can, wear face coverings on public transport and in most indoor public places, and take a test before going to high risk venues or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. All of these measures are helping to take the edge off the Omicron wave, slow the spread of infection, manage the immediate pressures on our NHS and buy time for the boosters to take effect. And those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should, of course, continue to follow the rules where they live. Mr Speaker, faced with these pressures on our NHS, I know some Members may ask the opposite question: whether we should go even further and move towards a full lockdown. But lockdowns are not cost free. They impose a devastating toll on our physical and mental wellbeing, on our businesses, jobs and livelihoods, and, worst of all, on the life chances of our children. So this government does not believe we need to shut down our country again. Instead we are taking a balanced approach, using the protection of the boosters and the Plan B measures to reduce the spread of the virus, while acting to strengthen our NHS, protect critical national services and keep supply chains open. We’re building onsite Nightingale hospitals and creating 2,500 virtual beds to increase NHS capacity. We’ve bought more antivirals per person than anywhere else in Europe. And we’re working to identify those NHS Trusts which are most likely to need military support, so this can be prepared now. From 10th January, we will provide 100,000 critical workers in England with free lateral flow tests for every working day to help keep essential services running. This includes those who work on critical national infrastructure, national security, transport, and food distribution and processing.  And these tests are separate – and in addition – to those already allocated to our public services, such as in education, where we have delivered 31 million testing kits to schools and colleges for the start of the new term. Mr Speaker, we have the biggest testing programme in Europe, registering almost twice as many tests as France, and four times as many as Germany. Last month alone, we distributed 300 million lateral flow devices – enabling millions of people to get tested and keep their loved ones, friends and colleagues safe in the run-up to Christmas. But thanks to the sheer size of the Omicron wave, we still need to take steps to ensure our testing capacity reaches those who need it most. So we will be suspending the need to do a PCR to confirm the result of a positive lateral flow test. From next Tuesday in England, if you test positive on a lateral flow device, you should just record that result on gov.uk and begin self-isolating. Mr Speaker, our balanced approach also means that where specific measures are no longer serving their purpose, they will be dropped. So when the Omicron variant was first identified, we rightly introduced travel restrictions to slow its arrival in our country. But now Omicron is so prevalent, these measures are having limited impact on the growth in cases, while continuing to pose significant costs on our travel industry. So I can announce that in England from 4am on Friday we will be scrapping the pre-departure test, which discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense. We will also be lifting the requirement to self-isolate on arrival until receipt of a negative PCR, returning instead to the system we had in October last year, where those arriving in England will need to take a lateral flow test no later than the end of Day 2 and, if positive, a further PCR test to help us identify any new variants at the border. Mr Speaker, all of these measures are balanced and proportionate ways of ensuring we can live with Covid without letting our guard down. And we can only do this thanks to the biggest and fastest booster campaign in Europe. Yet Mr Speaker, there are still almost 9 million people eligible, who haven’t had their booster. As many as 90 per cent of those in intensive care with Covid have not had their booster and over 60 per cent have not had any vaccination at all. And there are 2 million slots available over the next week alone. So I urge Hon Members on all sides of the House to do everything possible to encourage your constituents to get boosted now. This is the very best way to save lives, reduce the pressure on our NHS and keep our country open. And I commend this Statement to the House.

Boris:


27th November 2021 Press Conference with British Sign Language Good afternoon. The UK’s plan against Covid has been working. We’ve had the fastest vaccine roll-out in Europe, and now the fastest booster campaign in Europe, with almost 16.8 million boosters in people’s arms, and though case numbers have remained relatively high, we’re seen falling hospitalisations and falling numbers of deaths. But on Wednesday we received news of a new variant - the so-called Omicron Variant - I want to express my deep gratitude to scientists in South Africa who identified this new variant and shared this information widely and immediately. This variant is spreading around the world, with 2 cases so far identified here in the UK. As always, and I must stress this, as always with a new variant, there are many things that we just cannot know at this early stage. But our scientists are learning more hour by hour, and it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly, and can be spread between people who are double vaccinated. There is also a very extensive mutation which means it diverges quite significantly from previous configurations of the virus, and as result, it might - at least in part - reduce the protection of our vaccines over time. So we need to take targeted and proportionate measures now as a precaution while we find out more. First, we need to slow down the seeding of this variant in our country. We need to buy time for our scientists to understand exactly what we are dealing with. And for us to get more people vaccinated and - above all - to get more people boosted. As well as to help our NHS prepare in what is an already challenging winter. So yesterday we took steps to protect the UK against the variant coming here from southern African countries – and earlier today added four more countries to the red list. But we now need to go further and implement a proportionate testing regime for arrivals from across the whole world. So we are not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, we’re not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and to self-isolate until they have a negative result. Second, we need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the UK. Because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant, rather than stop it altogether. So in addition to the measures we are already taking to locate those who have been in countries of concern over the last ten days, we will require all contacts of those who test positive - with a suspected case of Omicron - to self-isolate for ten days, regardless of your vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this variant, by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport. And third - and most importantly - we need to bolster our protections against this new variant. We don’t yet exactly know how effective our vaccines will be against Omicron, but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. And if you are boosted – your response is likely to be stronger. So it’s more vital than ever that people get their jabs, and we get those boosters into arms as fast as possible. So from today we are going to boost the booster campaign. We are already planning to do 6 million jabs in England alone over the next three weeks. And now we are looking to go further, so the Health Secretary has asked the JCVI to consider giving boosters to as wide a group as possible, as well as reducing the gap between your second dose and your booster. And, of course, we are speaking to our counterparts in the Devolved Administrations and will continue to coordinate with them. The measures that we are taking today - including on our borders and face masks - are temporary and precautionary, and we will review them in three weeks. At that point we should have much greater information about the continuing effectiveness of our vaccines. I very much hope that we will find that we continue to be in a strong position, and we can lift these measures again. But right now this is the responsible course of action, to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new variant, and to maximise our defences so we protect the gains we have worked so hard for and so that we can continue to save lives. Thank you. 

Boris:


My Lord Mayor, My Late Lord Mayor, Your Grace, My Lord Chancellor, Your Excellencies, My Lords, Aldermen, Sheriffs, Chief Commoner, ladies and gentlemen. If I seem a little hoarse tonight, it’s nothing more epidemiologically serious than the well-known consequences of sending an 18 month old child to nursery. Fourteen days ago this country hosted the biggest gathering of world leaders since the foundation of the UN at the end of the Second World War. In fact it was far bigger: there were more than 120 heads of state and government. There has never been anything like it in our history. They came in such numbers not just because Glasgow is the place for a party, though clearly it is - glad we’ve got a good contingent of Glaswegians here tonight - not just because they wanted to be in the UK in November, famed for its good weather though it is. They came in those numbers because the scale of the crisis is unlike anything we have ever seen - an existential threat of manmade climate change that promises to destroy our environment as we know it, to rob our children and descendants of beauty and species and habitat at an unprecedented pace and to plunge humanity into a new dark ages, and I’m not joking, with warfare for basic resources such as water and vast and uncontrollable mass movements of people. They came to Glasgow because they have seen the ineluctable link between concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere and rises in temperature, and they came because they have all of them learnt the pure folly of disregarding the warnings of the scientists. And on Saturday night after years and months of work the nations of the earth came together and they forged the Glasgow Climate Pact. And of course that deal will and must have its critics and detractors from one side of the argument or the other, and we must be honest with our children, and we must confess that this deal this pact won’t do it alone. Glasgow won’t stop climate change, Glasgow won’t prevent the heating of the planet that is now baked in, but Glasgow can still help us to slow that warming down. What we have in our hands is now a road map: detailed, waymarked with milestone after milestone, and for the first time in history humanity has agreed to move beyond coal. I want to thank Alok Sharma for everything he did and for what he is going to do. Because our COP presidency didn’t end on Saturday, we are the “world COP-holders” for another year. We will build on the historic Glasgow Climate pact, which calls for countries to do better next year - accelerating the five-year cycle set out in the Paris agreement. We will push for more ambitious goals, stronger plans and better implementation, and so we further narrow that gap to 1.5 degrees. We will work from now on with partners across the world, because this is Global Britain in action. And I know how frustrating it was – as we stood on the verge of agreeing to phase out coal - to see that commitment weakened. But I tell you this: I have been watching politics a long time and human nature, and I know when a tipping point is reached. The language does matter, of course it does, whether you are talking about phasing down or phasing out, the day is now not far off when it will be as politically unacceptable, anywhere in the world, to open a new coal fired power station as it now is to get on to a plane and light a cigar. That is the social change that is afoot. We agreed to stop the terrible destruction of the forests, not just teeming with life and beauty, but the indispensable organs for fixing carbon and releasing oxygen. We signalled the global death knell for the fossil fuel driven internal combustion engine, and the developed world has started to wake up to its responsibilities, and showed that we understand the fundamental unfairness of asking the poorest and most vulnerable countries to make huge sacrifices to get to net zero, when they are by and large innocent of pumping carbon into the air. And if Glasgow has been on the whole a success, if we have made important progress, then it is worth pausing and asking ourselves why? What has changed since Madrid and Katowice and Paris and Copenhagen? And you can see how all sorts of things have come together in the minds of the leaders of the world. There is the data about what is actually happening: the storms, the floods, the fires, the swarms of locusts. There is the ever growing clamour from their electorates. Perhaps we were also helped in Glasgow by a collective sense of embarrassment at the way internationalism failed us during Covid: the squabbles about PPE, the crazy decisions of some countries, naming no names, to try to stop the export of vaccines to others, something we were victims of at the start of this year. And let me say – given all the speculation – that we would rather find a negotiated solution to the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and that still seems possible. But if we do invoke Article 16 - which by the way is a perfectly legitimate part of that Protocol – we will do so reasonably and appropriately, because we believe it is the only way left to protect the territorial integrity of our country, and meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland under the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. And I believe Glasgow worked because it was the first COP that brought the solutions with a new formula for beating climate change. And in that bee-like way of human beings we all started to swarm around the same intellectual hive. And the idea is that we can help individual countries to tackle decarbonisation, not just with taxpayers’ cash or loans, not just with the largesse of the multilateral development banks, but rather using that state funding to trigger the private sector to invest, so that we drive a green industrial revolution with millions of high wage high skill jobs at home and abroad. And perhaps the most striking example of this model a “country platform” with a specific agenda of green projects – was created through the leadership of Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, who ran the National Union of Mineworkers during the apartheid struggle, because he came up with a proposal to decarbonise his country with a just transition for the workers. This attracted a cluster of countries, including the UK, to offer a total of $8.5 bn as seed funding. And we are investing because we have seen how the model works here in the UK. Government sets the parameters, a government auction determines the strike price for – say – wind power and the private sector then has the confidence to invest in what the evidence now shows can be an immensely profitable business. And the UK will soon publish ten separate roadmaps showing exactly how we will deliver our green commitments - side-by-side with many of you here tonight -  covering electric vehicles, hydrogen and much else. Everyone has now seen the vital importance of the market and private finance and innovation and there is now a decent crop of very similar initiatives. We want to repeat this model everywhere, throughout Africa, throughout South East Asia and the Indian subcontinent, throughout Latin America. Using guarantees and all our innovative financial expertise to help create markets and get private capital flowing, and investing more as our economy recovers from Covid and we can afford to get back to 0.7% to help create a global green industrial revolution. The US has Build Back Better World, the UK has the Clean Green Initiative, the French have their One Planet initiative, the EU has its Global Gateway. It strikes me that we need to concert our activities, just as we forged new institutions after the Second World War. And I believe this concept of coalitions coalescing around science,  and security, and values,  finance and diplomacy and above all people, should be at the heart of what Global Britain is doing. Because it is clear that some countries are simply not going to evolve towards free market democracies and we should be clear eyed about that. We have to deal with it, we have to manage it, we must have relations that are as friendly and pragmatic as possible. But the consequence is that we work ever more closely with those who do share our values and instincts. So when we say that we support the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, that is not because we want to be adversarial to Russia, or that we want in some way strategically to encircle or undermine that great country. And never let it be forgotten, in this season of remembrance, that it was Russian blood that enabled us to defeat Nazism. It is because we have a commitment to democracy and freedom that is shared now across the vast mass of the European continent. And when our Polish friends asked for our help to deal with a contrived crisis on their border with Belarus, we were quick to respond. And we hope, I hope, that others may recognise, other European countries may recognise, that a choice is shortly coming, between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines, and sticking up for Ukraine  and championing the cause of peace and stability - let me put it that way. And on the same principle we do not send our Carrier Strike Group   8,000 miles to the South China seas because we are in any way hostile or adversarial to China, not at all, but because we want to show our commitment to the peace and stability of the whole Indo-Pacific region, and that’s why we exercised and operated with 36 of our friends, because freedom of the seas and open supply chains, are the lifeblood of the world economy. And that is the logic of the Indo-Pacific tilt that you will have read in the Integrated Review published earlier this year, and the Aukus arrangement. And this is not just a deal between friends: it is the beginning of cooperation on the defence and security aspects of technology of many kinds – from AI to Quantum to cyber. And that is how to express power and influence, that is how to win friends and win markets, not by encouraging others to run up unrepayable debts, not by bullying, but by creating these coalitions of the willing to fix the most urgent problems, and by staying at the forefront of technological advance. And if you have a problem around the world and you need help then let me suggest some reasons why this country, the UK, is the one to have in your coalition. It’s not just because we have record defence spending, the heavy lift capabilities that enabled us to help 36 other countries in Op Pitting from Afghanistan, the special forces, the intelligence services, and the diplomats, so well represented in this room, who by the way as Glasgow has shown us again, are pretty nifty at getting people in a room and finding the language to build a consensus. What we also have are the coders and the software engineers, the scientists and digital entrepreneurs,  oh and by the way – we have the bankers too and the lawyers – and the regulators. You want a country that can do scientific breakthroughs, come to us: there is a reason why we have more tech unicorns than anywhere else in Europe. It’s because on the whole people like to come and live and work in the UK, they like the freedom of thought and expression and the rule of law and the nightlife  and the museums, and the fact that provided they do no harm to others, on the principle of JS Mill, they can live their lives here as they please. And that is broadly why we have so many outstanding universities and so many Nobel Prizes. And we mean now to turbo-charge that, if you can turbo-charge a non-hydrocarbon engine. The other day I met Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind, which is an extraordinary company located near King’s Cross, and he told me about AI which is not a two toed sloth you use in Scrabble by the way, but artificial intelligence and he more or less blew my mind, because AI transcends the limits of our poor mammalian brains, crunches problems with astonishing speed, but also somehow creatively and intuitively, so that DeepMind has beaten all comers at Go. It is already being used to predict where the wind will blow and therefore where is the optimal place to locate your turbines and to predict any maintenance issues before they arise. And the cost of offshore wind power has already fallen by 60 per cent in the last ten years, partly thanks to AI, and you can see the potential of AI to drive it down still further. We are already using AI to rationalise energy use in the vast data storage centres that are so important to the global economy, and DeepMind has worked out how to cut the use of energy in Google data centres by 40 per cent. Imagine if we could make the same economy in the national grid. And Demis Hassabis told me how they could now use AI to predict the plasma waves inside a fusion reactor, so as to harvest the energy while controlling the extraordinary temperatures, and I know – fusion may still be a few years away: it was 20 years away 20 years ago. But when you look at what AI is already achieving, we should have the humility to accept that he might well be right and that AI could be bigger than the internet. And so the right thing for the UK to do now is to recognise this progress and support these amazing industries. We will develop our own coders and bioscientists. We will train up young people in this country, but we will also welcome the brains of the world. We will roll out the red carpet, and kill the fatted calf for the maths Olympiad victors, and the physics geniuses and anybody happens to be watching this while proving Fermat’s last theorem with one hand, and doing the washing up with the other, then get on to our Office for Global Talent and we will sort you out with a visa. And we will take advantage of our new legislative freedoms to regulate with a light touch  with minimum bossiness about the management of data. The new Advanced Research and Invention Agency will pursue the search for the things we don’t know we don’t know. And we will set particular targets and ambitions: last year we took a risk and invested in satellites called OneWeb; we now have 358 in orbit and they are on the way to providing high speed internet access to people everywhere. And we know that our national security and prosperity depend on this country’s technological prowess, and we also know that by placing our national advantage at the service of addressing common problems, we will strengthen our friendships around the world. Having talked to Demis Hassabis and to Eric Schmidt, formerly of Google, it is clear that we need to go big on Quantum Computing. If AI can mimic the intuitive flair of the human brain, then Quantum computing will enable us to process information so fast that we can process an almost infinite number of solutions at once. And if we could perfect it there are so many problems we could solve: including how to turn nitrogen into fertiliser and feed the world without creating so much C02. So I am setting the ambition that the UK will aim to build the first general purpose quantum computer, and secure fifty percent of the global quantum computing market by 2040. And that is why this country is determined to become once again a science superpower. We know that is the way to create 100,000s of jobs in the green industries of the future. Indeed it is at present levelling up across the whole country, as you rightly said my Lord Mayor. It is the way to ensure that we are not dependent on the technology of others in a way that could ultimately compromise our national security. And with our lead in the technologies of tomorrow we can help spread our values, just as we helped to distribute 1.5 bn low cost Astra Zeneca vaccines, and help to fix the problems of humanity. And that is how Global Britain can influence things for the better, not with gunboats, or not solely with gunboats, not with usurious loans, but with public billions leveraging private trillions to drive the expansion of new technological solutions, from bioscience to carbon capture and storage and the production of green hydrogen. I am finally optimistic tonight because COP has shown us that climate change may still be terrifying and complacency would be fatal, but we in the UK have the tools, we have the science, we have the finance, and the expertise, and we certainly have the global reach and we want to be your partner. Not just because it will drive jobs and growth in the UK, though it certainly will, but for the good of all humanity and all other species – including unicorns - and for the air that gives us life. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker before I begin today’s statement I would like to say a few words about the abhorrent attack that took place yesterday morning outside the Liverpool Women’s Hospital. On behalf of the whole House I want to pay tribute to the swift and professional response by the extraordinary men and women of the emergency services, who once again showed themselves to be the very best among us. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has today raised the nationwide threat level from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. The police are keeping both myself and the Home Secretary informed on developments and we will of course in turn keep the House updated on the investigation as it continues. And now Mr Speaker with your permission I should like to make a statement on the United Nations Climate Change Conference better known as COP26 which took place in the magnificent city of Glasgow over the past two weeks. It was the biggest political gathering of any kind ever held in the United Kingdom. 194 countries were represented. We had around 120 heads of state or government. 38,000 accredited delegates. And there were countless tens of thousands more in the streets and parks and venues outside. It was a summit that many people predicted would fail. A summit that I fear some quietly wanted to fail. Yet it was a summit that proved the doubters and the cynics wrong. Because COP26 did not just succeed in keeping 1.5 alive. It succeeded in doing something no UN climate conference has ever done before by uniting the world in calling time on coal. In 25 previous COPs, all the way back to Berlin in 1995, not one delivered a mandate to remove so much as a single lump of coal from one power station boiler. For decades, tackling the single biggest cause of carbon emissions proved as challenging as eating the proverbial elephant. It was just so big that no one knew quite where to start. But in Glasgow, Mr Speaker, we took the first bite. Because we have secured a global commitment to phasing down coal – and as John Kerry has pointed out, you can’t phase out coal without first phasing it down as we transition to other, cleaner energy sources – and we have, for the first time, a worldwide recognition that we’ll not get climate change under control as long as our power stations are consuming vast quantities of the sedimentary super-polluter that is coal. That alone is a great achievement, but we haven’t just signalled the beginning of the end for coal. We’ve ticked our boxes on cars, cash and trees as well. The companies that build a quarter of the world’s automobiles have agreed to stop building carbon emission vehicles by 2035 – and cities from Sao Paulo to Seattle have pledged to ban them from their streets. We’ve pioneered a whole new model, an intellectual breakthrough, that sees billions in climate finance, development bank investment and so forth being used to trigger trillions from the private sector to drive the big decarbonisation programmes in countries like South Africa. And we’ve done something that absolutely none of the commentators saw coming by building a coalition of more than 130 countries to protect up to 90 per cent of our forests, those great natural soakers of carbon. Mr Speaker none of this was a happy accident or inevitability. The fact that we were there at all, in the face of a global pandemic, is in itself the result of a vast and complex effort involving countless moving parts. Right until the very end there was a very real prospect that no agreement would be reached. And what has been achieved has only come about thanks to month after month of concerted British diplomacy, the countless meetings, the innumerable phone calls. The banging of heads at UNGA, at the Petersberg Dialogue, at President Biden’s climate summit, the Security Council, the G7, the G20. And the setting of an example, several examples by the UK. Because again and again the task of our negotiators was made easier by the fact that the UK wasn’t asking anyone to do anything we’re not doing ourselves. We’ve slashed our use of coal so much that our last two coal-fired power stations will go offline for good in 2024. We’ve more than doubled our climate finance, providing vital support for poor and vulnerable nations around the world. We’ve made a legally binding commitment to reach net zero, the first of the major economies to do so. We’ve set a date at which hydrocarbon internal combustion engines will reach the end of the road. And we’ve shown the world that it’s possible to grow your economy while cutting carbon – creating markets for clean technology and delivering new green jobs that reduce emissions and increase prosperity. Every one of those achievements was not just great news for our country and our planet but another arrow in the quiver of our fantastic team in Glasgow. A team led by COP president the Rt Hon Member for Reading West. From the moment he picked up the COP reins he has been absolutely tireless in his efforts to secure the change that we need. And while I’m pretty sure that what he really needs right now is a well-deserved break I don’t think any of us here will be able to hold him back as he sets off pushing countries to go further still and making sure the promises made in Glasgow are delivered not diluted. But success has many parents and I want to say a huge thank you to the officials in our own COP unit, in Downing Street and across government in embassies around the world, and at the United Nations who pulled out all the stops to make the event work and shepherd through the agreements that have been reached. I also want to thank everyone on the ground at the SEC in Glasgow – security, catering, transport, the relentlessly cheery volunteers, the police from across the country who kept us safe from harm, the public health authorities who kept us safe from Covid – and everyone in the Scottish Government. And above all I want to say thank you to the people of Glasgow, who had to put up with so much disruption in their city and welcomed the world all the same. I say to the people of Glasgow - we couldn’t have done it without you. Is there still more to do? Of course there is. I am not for one moment suggesting we can safely close the book on climate change. In fact I can think of nothing more dangerous than patting ourselves on the back and telling ourselves that the job is done. Because this job will not be complete until the whole world has not only set off to reach net zero but arrived at the destination. A goal that, even with the best of intentions from all actors, cannot be achieved overnight. While COP26 has filled me with optimism about our ability to get there I cannot now claim to be certain that we will, because we have seen countries that really should know better dragging their heels on their Paris commitments. But if, and it is still an if, they make good on their pledges, then I believe Glasgow will be remembered as the place where we secured an historic agreement and the world began to turn the tide. Before Paris we were on course for four degrees of warming. After Paris that number fell to a still catastrophically dangerous three. This afternoon, after Glasgow it stands close to two. Still too high, the numbers are still too hot, but closer than we have ever been to the relative safety of 1.5, and with an all-new roadmap that will lead us there. Aristotle taught us that virtue comes not from reasoning and instruction but from habit and practice. And so the success of the Glasgow Climate Pact lies not just in the promises but in the move that the whole world has now made from setting abstract targets to adopting the nuts and bolts programme of work to meet those targets and to reduce CO2 emissions. We are now talking about the how rather than the what and getting into a habit of cutting CO2 that is catching on not just with governments but with businesses and with billions of people around the world. It is for that reason that I believe COP26 has been a success and 1.5 is still alive. That is something in which every person in our United Kingdom can and should take pride, and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Six years ago the Paris Agreement made an historic commitment to end the destruction and devastation caused by climate change. Together they agreed to limit global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees with a view to keeping that increase at 1.5 degrees. But hundreds of summits, speeches, press conferences like this later, those words and promises are starting to sound, frankly, hollow. The science is clear that we need to act now to halve emissions by 2030 and keep 1.5 degrees within reach. There are no compelling excuses for our procrastination. Not only have we acknowledged the problem, we are already seeing first-hand the devastation climate change causes: from heat waves and droughts to wildfires and hurricanes. And unlike many other global challenges, the solution to climate change is clear. It lies in consigning dirty fossil fuels like coal to history, in ditching gas guzzling modes of transport and recognising the role that nature plays in preserving life on this planet, and harnessing the power of nature through renewable energy rather than orchestrating its destruction. If we don’t act right know the Paris agreement will be looked at in the future not as the moment humanity opened its eyes to the problem, but the moment we flinched and turned away. We’ve seen some progress in the last few days and weeks. Saudi Arabia, Australia and Russia have all made net zero commitments – meaning 80% of the global economy will wipe out its contribution to climate change by the middle of the century, up from 30% thanks to the UK’s COP26 leadership. Countries such as the United States have doubled their spending on climate aid. Every nation at this weekend’s summit will end the financial support for international unabated coal projects by the end of this year. But these commitments, welcome as they are, are drops in a rapidly warming ocean when we consider the challenge we have all admitted is ahead of us. Just 12 G20 members have committed to reach net zero by 2050 or earlier. Barely half of us have submitted improved plans for how we will cut carbon emissions since the Paris Summit in 2015. And we have also failed to meet our commitment to provide $100bn a year to support developing countries to grow in a clean and sustainable way. The UN says emissions will rise by 15% by 2030, and they need to halve by then. The countries most responsible for historic and present-day emissions are not yet doing their fair share of the work. If we are going to Prevent COP26 from being a failure then that must change. And I must be clear, that if Glasgow fails, then the whole thing fails. The Paris Agreement will have crumpled at the first reckoning. The world’s only mechanism, viable mechanism, for dealing with climate change will be holed beneath the water line. Right now the Paris Agreement, and the hope that came with it, is just a piece of paper. We need to fill that piece of paper to populate it with real progress. And I know that humanity has in it the power to rise to the challenge. The UK has proved it can be done – we have lowered our greenhouse gas emissions by 44% in the last 30 years whilst increasing our GDP by 78%. And we’re cutting our contribution to climate change more and more every day. We have made some progress at this G20. We have had a reasonable G20, but there is a huge way still to go. We all know that we have the technology. What we need to do now is to raise the finance, but above all we need the political will, in Glasgow, to make those commitments. And to keep alive the hope of restraining the growth of our temperatures to 1.5 degrees. Thank you very much and see you in Glasgow. 

Boris:


Thank you, thank you very much Mr President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentleman. Great speech Mario and ciao from Londra. I’m very sorry I’m not able to be with you today, but I just want to say to all of you at this gathering: Mario, you and I, we’ve got to face it. We were born in the 1960s; the politicians, I’m afraid, like us -  we’re middle aged people. And we’re going to be meeting to thrash out the world’s path to net zero in just a few weeks’ time at COP26. But it will be the people in the audience, it will be your generation, young people, who are left to deal with the consequences if we should fail. Because a child born in 2020 will endure seven times as many extreme heatwaves and twice as many droughts as their grandparents. And as this gathering has heard in sometimes harrowing detail, young people around the world are already paying the price for the reckless actions of their elders. Hundreds of millions of you are facing rising seas, failing crops, burning forests and ever-more ferocious storms. Daily challenges that lead to lost opportunity. Your future is being stolen before your eyes, and I saw the protestors earlier on, and frankly you have every right to be angry with those who aren’t doing enough to stop it. And perhaps the most frustrating thing is that we know we can stop it. There is still just enough time to put on the brakes. We know what needs to be done, we just have to get on with it. It’s a big task, one that will ask a lot of absolutely everybody. But change on the scale we need is perfectly possible. When I was a child something like 80 per cent of the UK’s electricity was generated by burning coal. Even as recently as 2010 we got 10 times more electricity from fossil fuels than from renewables. Yet today, as I speak to you, most of the electricity consumed in the UK comes from clean green sources. Our carbon emissions are barely half what they were in 1990. And coal, which was once the undisputed king of our energy mix, now accounts for less than two per cent of our electricity – a number that will hit zero within the next couple of years. I tell you this not because I want to brag about how great the UK is – because I’m the first to admit that we all have much more to do – but because I want to show what can be achieved when people and politicians have the will to make change happen. That’s why it’s so important that these three days are not the end of the story. We’ve got 190 countries represented here, almost 190 countries represented here. And if between now and November, the COP26 Summit, that you all continue to raise your voices in the way that you have, as passionately and articulately as you are doing; and if you can keep talking to the politicians and the business leaders where you live about this issue and why you care about it and why we must have action - then what I’m saying to you is we can turn this thing around. And the four things we want to come out of COP26, four big changes in our approach, and it’s very easy to remember – it’s coal, cars, cash and trees; coal cars, cash and trees. We want to move away, as I’ve described, from using coal as the way we generate electricity, we want to move to move towards renewables. We want all the countries in the world to move off coal. We want everybody to stop using internal combustion engine vehicles, and it can be done, people are moving away from them as we speak. As Mario has just said in his really excellent speech, we want to raise the funds that the whole world needs, the developing world in particular, to tackle climate change - and we need to get up to $100 billion. And we need to plant 100s of millions if not trillions of trees around the world. If we do all that, we can make COP26 in November, which Mario and I are working on, we can make it the beginning of the end of climate change. So without being unduly rhapsodical, when you’re my age, you young folks, you young thrusters out there, you’ll inhabit not a world on fire, but a planet where your phones and your computers and your lights are powered by the wind and the water, the waves and the sun; You’ll inhabit a world where electric cars glide silently down your streets from California to Cape Town;  emission-free, guilt-free jet zero planes will fly overhead; and all of us will be able to deal with whatever the climate throws at us. So what I’m saying to you is that the situation is dire, it is frightening, but change is possible and it can be done. So help me and help us to make it happen at COP26. And together let’s make this earth the planet that you deserve. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


PM statement to the House of Commons on health and social care: 7 September 2021 Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement on the government’s plans for health and social care. Our National Health Service is the pride of our whole United Kingdom and all the more so, after it has been there for us during the worst pandemic in a century, treating almost half a million patients, administering more than 88 million vaccines and saving countless lives. But the inevitable consequence of this necessary - and extraordinary – action is that Covid has placed massive pressures on our NHS. As we stayed at home to protect the NHS, thousands of people did not come forward for the treatment they needed. Like those who suffer from Covid, these are all people we know. Your aunt who needs a new hip. Your neighbour who has problems with their heart and needs a pacemaker. Your friends your friends at work who thinks they should get that lump or cough checked out. So we must now help the NHS to recover, to be able to provide this much needed care to our constituents and the people we love – and we must provide the funding to do so now. We not only have to pay for the operations and treatments that people decided not to have during the pandemic, we need to pay good wages for the 50,000 nurses who will enable that treatment, and who can help us tackle waiting lists that could otherwise expand to 13 million over the next few years. We need to now to go beyond the record funding we have already provided – and we need to go further than the 48 hospitals and 50 million more GP appointments that are already in our plan. So today we are beginning the biggest catch-up programme in NHS history, tackling the Covid backlogs by increasing hospital capacity to 110 per cent, and enabling nine million more appointments, scans and operations. As a result, while waiting lists will get worse before they get better, the NHS will aim to be treating around 30 per cent more elective patients by 2024/25 than before Covid. And we will also fix the long-term problems of health and social care of health and social care have been so cruelly have been so cruelly exposed by Covid. But having spent more than £407 billion or more to support lives and livelihoods throughout the pandemic - from furlough to vaccines - it would be wrong for me to say that we can pay for this recovery without taking the difficult but responsible decisions about how we finance it. As a permanent additional investment in health and social care – it would be irresponsible to meet the costs from higher borrowing and higher debt. From next April we will create a new, UK-wide, 1.25 per cent Health and Social Care Levy on earned income, hypothecated in law to health and social care, with dividends rates increasing by the same amount. This will raise almost £36 billion over the next three years, with money from the levy going directly to health and social care across the whole of our United Kingdom. This won’t be pay awards for middle management, it will go straight to the front line at a time when we need to get more out of our health and social care system than ever before. And it will enable radical innovation to improve the speed and quality of care, including better screening equipment to diagnose serious diseases, such as cancer, more quickly, designated surgical facilities so non-urgent patients are no longer competing with A&amp;E, faster GP access to specialists, so you don’t have to wait months to see someone in hospital to find out whether something is wrong, and new digital technology so doctors can monitor patients remotely in their homes. And we will do all this in a way that is right, and reasonable and fair. Mr Speaker, some will ask why we don’t increase income tax or capital gains instead. But income tax isn’t paid by businesses, so the whole burden would fall on individuals, roughly doubling the amount that the basic rate taxpayer could expect to pay. And the total revenue from capital gains tax amounts to less than £9 billion this year. Instead our new levy will share the cost between individuals and businesses, and everyone will contribute according to their means, including those above State Pension Age, so those who earn more those who earn more will pay more. And because we are also increasing dividends tax rates we will be asking better-off business owners and investors to make a fair contribution too. In fact, the highest earning 14 per cent will pay around half the revenues, no-one earning less than £9,568 will pay a penny, and the majority of small businesses will be protected, with 40 per cent of all businesses paying nothing at all. And while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own systems, we will direct money raised through the levy to their health and social care services. So in total Scotland - yes - in total Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will benefit from an extra £2.2 billion a year Mr Speaker - and as this is about 15 per cent more than they will contribute through the levy, it will create a union dividend worth £300 million. Worth £300 million. But Mr Speaker, we cannot just put more money in. We need reform and change. We need to build back better from Covid. When the Covid storm broke last year there were 30,000 hospital beds in England occupied by people who could have been better cared for elsewhere – and who wanted to be better cared elsewhere. That is 30,000 Mr Speaker out of 100,000 hospital beds in our NHS, costing billions every night, and unable to be used by people needing cancer care needing hip operations, making it harder than ever to deal with the growing backlog in our NHS. Too often people were in hospital beds because they or their relatives were worried about the cost of care in a residential home. And that same fear kept many others at home without any care at all. This anxiety affects millions of people up and down the country, the fear that a condition like dementia, one of nature’s bolts from the blue could lead to the total liquidation of their assets, their lifetime savings, their home - the loss of everything that they might otherwise pass on to their children, however great or small - while sufferers from other diseases – who have had to be in hospital for the majority of their treatment – have their care paid for in full by the NHS. Governments have ducked this problem for decades. Parliament parliament even voted to fix it, and yet that 30,000 figure is an indictment of the failure to do so. And so Mr Speaker there can be no more dither and delay. We know we can’t rely solely we know we can’t rely solely on private insurance because demand would be too low for insurers to offer an affordable price. And a universal system of free care for all would be needlessly expensive, when those who can afford to contribute to their care should do so. Instead the state should target its help at protecting people against the catastrophic fear of losing everything to pay for the cost of their care, and that is what this government will do. We are setting a limit on what people can be asked to pay, and we will be working with the financial services industry to innovate and help people to insure themselves against expenditure up to that limit. Wherever you live, whatever your age, your income or your condition, from October 2023 no-one starting care will pay more than £86,000 over their lifetime, and no-one with assets of less than £20,000 no-one with assets of less than £20,000 will have to make any contribution from their savings or housing wealth – up from £14,000 today. Meanwhile anyone with assets between £20,000 and £100,000 will be eligible for some means-tested support. And this new upper capital limit of £100,000 is more than four times the current limit, helping many more people with modest assets. And as we fix this long-term long-standing problem in social care, we will also address the fears that many have about how their loved ones will be looked after, by investing in the quality of care, in carers themselves, and by integrating health and care in England so older people and disabled people are cared for better, with dignity, and in the right setting. And my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care will be bringing forward a White Paper on integration later this year. Mr Speaker, you can’t fix you can’t fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs; you can’t fix the NHS without fixing social care; you can’t fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care; and you can’t fix health and social care without long-term reform. The plan that this Government is setting out today, the plan I am setting out today will fix all of those problems together. And, of course, and, of course, no Conservative government no Conservative government mr speaker ever wants to raise taxes, and I will be honest with the House, I accept yes I accept this breaks a manifesto commitment, which is not something I do lightly. But a global pandemic was in no-one’s manifesto Mr Speaker. I think the people in this country understand that in their bones and they can see the enormous debts this Government the Treasury has taken. After all the extraordinary actions that have been taken to protect lives and livelihoods over the last eighteen months, this is the right, the reasonable and fair approach, enabling our amazing NHS to come back strongly from the crisis, tackling the Covid backlogs, funding our nurses, making sure people get the care and treatment they need, in the right place at the right time, and ending a chronic and unfair anxiety for millions of people and their families up and down this country. And I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will update the House on the situation in Afghanistan, and our enduring effort to provide sanctuary for those to whom we owe so much. Since the House last met, our armed forces, diplomats and civil servants have completed the biggest and fastest emergency evacuation in recent history, overcoming every possible challenge, in the most harrowing conditions -and bringing 15,000 people to safety in the UK and helping 36 other countries airlift their own nationals. They faced the pressure of a remorseless deadline, and witnessed a contemptible terrorist attack at the very gates of the airport, with two British nationals and thirteen of our American allies among the dead. But they kept going and in the space of a fortnight they evacuated our own nationals alongside Afghan friends of this country who guided, translated and served with our soldiers and officials, proving their courage and loyalty beyond doubt - sometimes in the heat of battle. The whole House will join me in commending the courage and ingenuity of everyone involved in the Kabul Airlift, one of the most spectacular operations in our country’s post-war military history. This feat exemplified the spirit of all 150,000 British service men and women who deployed in Afghanistan over the last two decades, of whom 457 laid down their lives and many others suffered trauma and injury. Thanks to their efforts, no terrorist attack against this country or any of our Western allies has been launched from Afghanistan for twenty years. They fulfilled the first duty of the British armed forces - to keep our people safe - and they and their families should take pride in everything they did. Just as they kept us safe, so we shall do right by our veterans. In addition to the extra £3 million we have invested in mental health support through NHS Op Courage, we are providing another £5 million to assist the military charities who do such magnificent work, with the aim of ensuring that no veteran’s request for help will go unanswered. And now the evacuation – Op Pitting – will give way to Operation Warm Welcome,  with an equal effort to help our Afghan friends begin their new lives here in the United Kingdom, and recognising the strength of feeling across the House about the plight of individual Afghans. Years before this episode, we began to fulfil our obligation to those Afghans who had helped us, bringing 1,400 to the UK. Then, in April this year, we expanded our efforts by opening the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy,   and even before the onset of Operation Pitting we had brought around 2,000 to the UK between June and August.
And our obligation lives on. So let me say to anyone to whom we have made commitments - and who is currently in Afghanistan – we are working urgently with our friends in the region to secure safe passage and as soon as routes are available we will do everything possible to help you to reach safety. Over and above this effort, the UK is formally launching a separate resettlement programme, providing a safe and legal route for up to 20,000 Afghans in the region over the coming years, with 5,000 in the first year. We are upholding Britain’s finest tradition of welcoming those in need and I emphasise that under this scheme we will of course work with the UN and aid agencies to identify those we should help, as we have done in respect of those who fled the war in Syria – but we will also include Afghans who have contributed to civil society or who face a particular risk from the Taliban, for example, because of their role in standing up for democracy and human rights, or because of their gender, or sexuality or religion. All who come to our country through this safe and legal route will receive not a five year visa, but indefinite leave to remain and our support will include free English courses for adults, and 300 university scholarships. We will shortly be writing to local authorities and the Devolved Administrations with details on funding for extra school places and long-term accommodation across the UK. I am grateful for everything they are doing, and, of course, for the work of my Honourable Friend the Minister for Afghan resettlement. I am delighted – but not surprised – that across our country, people have been fundraising for our Afghan friends and we have received numerous offers of help from charities and ordinary families alike, and anyone who wishes to join that effort can do so through gov.uk. Mr Speaker, our first duty is the security of the United Kingdom and if the new regime in Kabul wants international recognition and access to the billions of dollars currently frozen in overseas accounts, then we and our friends will hold them to their agreement to prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming an incubator for terrorism. And we shall insist on safe passage for anyone who wishes to leave, and respect for the rights of women and girls.
Our aim is to rally the strongest international consensus behind these principles, so that as far as possible the world speaks to the Taliban with one voice. To that end, I called an emergency meeting of G7 leaders which made these aims the basis of our common approach, and the UK helped to secure a UN Resolution, passed by the Security Council last week, making the same demands. Later this month, at the UN General Assembly in New York, I will work with Secretary-General Guterres and other leaders to widen that consensus still further. We will judge the Taliban by their actions not their words and use every economic, political and diplomatic lever to protect our own countries from harm and to help the Afghan people. We have already doubled the UK’s humanitarian and development assistance to £286 million this year, including to help people in the region. Mr Speaker, on Saturday we shall mark the 20th anniversary of the reason why we went into Afghanistan in the first place: the terrorist attacks on the United States which claimed 2,977 lives, including those of 67 Britons. And if anyone is still tempted to say that we have achieved nothing in that country in twenty years, tell them that our armed forces and those of our allies enabled 3.6 million girls to go to school; tell them that this country and the Western world were protected from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan throughout that period; and tell them we have just mounted the biggest humanitarian airlift in recent history: eight times, the RAF rescued more than 400 people on board a single plane – the most that have ever travelled on an RAF aircraft in its 103 year history, helping thousands of people in fear for their lives, helping thousands to whom this country owes so much, and thereby revealing the fundamental values of the United Kingdom. There are very few countries that have the military capability to do what we have just done and fewer still who would have felt the moral imperative to act in the same way. We can be proud of our forces for everything they have achieved and for the legacy they leave behind. And what they did was in the best traditions of this country, and I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move – and may I begin by thanking you and all the Parliamentary staff for enabling us to meet this morning. Before I turn to today’s debate, I am sure the House will want to join you and me in sending our condolences to the family and friends of those killed in the appalling shooting in Plymouth last week. Investigations are, of course, continuing but we will learn every possible lesson from this tragedy. Mr Speaker, I know that Members across the House share my concern about the situation in Afghanistan, issues it raises for our own security, and the fears of many remaining in that country – especially women and children. The sacrifice in Afghanistan is seared into our national consciousness, with 150,000 people serving there from across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom, including a number of Members on all sides of the House, whose voices will be particularly important today. And so it is absolutely right that we should come together for this debate. I thank my honourable friend and I can assure him that I will be saying in just a few moments, we will be doing everything we can to support those who have helped the UK mission in Afghanistan and investing everything we can to support the wider area around Afghanistan and to do everything we can to avert a humanitarian crisis. Mr Speaker, it is almost twenty years since the United States suffered the most catastrophic attack on its people since the Second World War, in which 67 British citizens also lost their lives at the hands of murderous terrorist groups incubated in Afghanistan. In response, NATO invoked Article V of its Treaty, for the first and only time in its history, and the United Kingdom, amongst others, joined America in going into Afghanistan on a mission to extirpate Al Qaeda in that country and to do whatever we could to stabilise Afghanistan, in spite of all the difficulties and challenges we knew that we would face. And we succeeded in that core mission. As I said in the House just a few weeks ago, there was an extensive defence review about the Afghan mission after the combat mission ended in 2014, and I believe most of the key questions have already been extensively gone into. It’s important Mr Speaker that we in this House should be able to scrutinise events as they unfold. Mr Speaker, we succeeded in that core mission and the training camps in the mountain ranges of Afghanistan were destroyed, Al Qaeda plots against this country were foiled because our serving men and women were there, and no successful terrorist attacks against the West have been mounted from Afghan soil for two decades. Mr Speaker, I think it would be fair to say that the events in Afghanistan have unfolded and the collapse has been faster than I think even the Taliban themselves predicted. What is not true is to say that the UK Government was unprepared or did not forsee this, because it was certainly part of our planning, of pitting the very difficult logistical operation for the withdrawal of UK nationals has been under preparation for many months Mr Speaker,  and I can tell the house that the decision to commission the emergency handling centre at the airport took place two weeks ago, Mr Speaker Alongside this core mission, we worked for a better future for the people of Afghanistan. And the heroism and tireless work of our armed forces contributed to national elections, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights and equalities in a way that many in Afghanistan had not previously known. Whereas twenty years ago almost no girls went to school and women were banned from positions of governance, now 3.6 million girls have been in school this year alone, and women hold over a quarter of the seats in Afghanistan’s parliament. But Mr Speaker, we must be honest and accept that huge difficulties were encountered at each turn and some of this progress is fragile. The honourable gentleman raises exactly the right question. I spoke this morning to Ambassador Sir Laurie Bristow as well as to Brigadier Dan Blanchford who is handling the evacuation And it would be fair to say the situation has stabilised since the weekend but it remains precarious and the UK officials on the ground are doing everything that they can to expedite the movement of people, those that need to come out, whether from ARUP scheme or eligible persons to get from Kabul to the airport. And at the moment it would be fair to say the Taliban are allowing that evacuation to go ahead. But the most important thing is that we get this done in as expeditious a fashion as we can, and that’s what we are doing. And I may say that I am grateful not just to the UK forces who are now out there helping to stabilise the airport but also to the US forces as well The combat phase of our mission ended in 2014 when we brought the vast majority of our troops home and handed over responsibility for security to the Afghans themselves, and we continued to support their efforts Even at that stage, we should remember that conflict was continuous, and that in spite of the bravery and sacrifice of the Afghan army – and we should never forget that 69,000 of those Afghan army troops have given their lives in this conflict – significant parts of the country remained contested or under Taliban control. And so when after two decades, the Americans prepared to take their long-predicted and well-trailed step of a final extraction of their forces, we looked at many options, Mr Speaker, including the potential for staying longer ourselves, finding new partners, or even increasing our presence, I think that when he asked for a commentary on the respective military potential power of the Taliban and the Afghan forces, it’s pretty clear from what has happened that the collapse of the Afghan forces has been much faster than expected And as for our NATO allies and our allies around the world, when it came for us to look at the options that this country might have in view of the American decision to withdraw, we came up against this hard reality that since 2009, America has deployed 98 per cent of all weapons released from NATO aircraft in Afghanistan, and at the peak of the operation, when there were 132,000 troops on the ground, 90,000 of them were American. The West could not continue this US-led mission, a mission conceived and executed in support and defence of America, without American logistics, without US air power and without American might. I spoke to Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO only the other day about NATO’s continuing role in Afghanistan. But I really think it is an illusion to believe that there is appetite amongst any of our partners for a continued military presence or for a military solution imposed by NATO in Afghanistan. The idea ended with the combat mission in 2014 and I do not believe that today deploying tens of thousands of British troops to fight the Taliban is an option, no matter how sincerely people may advocate it, and I appreciate their sincerity, but I do not believe that is an option that would commend itself either to the British people or to this House. Mr Speaker, we must deal with the position as it now is, accepting what we have achieved and what we have not achieved. The government has been working around the clock to deal with the unfolding situation. We must deal with the world as it is, accepting what we have achieved and what we have not achieved. The UK will work with our international partners on a shared plan to support the people of Afghanistan and to contribute to regional stability. There will be five parts, Mr Speaker, to this approach. First, our immediate focus must be on helping those to whom we have direct obligations, by evacuating UK nationals, together with those Afghans who have assisted our efforts over the past twenty years. And I know the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the bravery and commitment of our Ambassador, Sir Laurie Bristow, I thank the right honourable gentleman for raising the very needy case that he does. I am sure that colleagues across the House, literally every member will I imagine have received messages from people who know someone who needs to get out of Afghanistan, And I can tell the right honourable gentleman that we are doing everything we can to help out of that country those people to whom we owe a debt of obligation And on that point, I want to repeat my thanks, not just to Sir Laurie Bristow, but also our commander on the ground, Brigadier Dan Blanchford and the entire British team in Kabul. I can tell the House that we have so far secured the safe return of 306 UK nationals and 2,052 Afghan nationals as part of our resettlement programme, with a further 2,000 Afghan applications completed and many more being processed. UK officials are working round the clock to keep the exit door open in the most difficult circumstances, and actively seeking those we believe are eligible but as yet unregistered. That’s why it’s been so important that we maintain a presence at Kabul airport and that’s why we’ve been getting the message out that we want people to come through As I said earlier on, it is important for everybody to understand that at the moment in the days that we have ahead of us, which may be short, but at the moment, this is an environment in which the Taliban are permitting the evacuation to take place. Mr Speaker, these are interpreters, they are locally engaged staff and others who have risked their lives supporting our military efforts and seeking to secure new freedoms for their country. We are proud to bring these brave Afghans to our shores – and we continue to appeal for more to come forwards. Mr Speaker, that’s the 5000 on whom we are spending £200 million to bring a further 5000 on top – I think it will be 10,000 altogether that we bring under the ARUP and other programmes. We will be increasing that number over the coming years as I said to 20,000. But the bulk of the effort of this country will be directed, and should be directed, to supporting people in Afghanistan and in the region in order to prevent a worse humanitarian crisis I tell the House that in that conviction I am supported very strongly both by President Macron of France and by Chancellor Merkel of Germany. We are also doing everything possible to accelerate the visas – we are making sure that we bring back the 35 brilliant Chevening scholars, so that they can come and study in our great universities. We are deploying an additional 800 British troops to support this evacuation operation, and I can assure the House that we will continue this operation for as long as conditions at the airport allow. We will not be sending people back to Afghanistan and nor by the way will we be allowing people to come from Afghanistan to this country in an indiscriminate way. We want to be generous but we must make sure we look after our own security. Over the coming weeks, we will redouble our efforts, working with others to protect the British homeland and all our citizens and interests, from any threats that may emanate from a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, from terrorism to the narcotics trade. Like many of us I have been extensively lobbied on behalf of the excellent work done by Mr Pen Farthing – I am well aware of his cause and all the wonderful things he has done. And for animals in Afghanistan I can tell my honourable friend that we will do everything we can to help Mr Pen Farthing and others who face particular difficulty like himself But as I say without in any way jeopardising our own national security These are concerns shared across the international community, from the region itself to all the NATO alliance and indeed all five permanent members of the UN Security Council. and I will chair a virtual meeting of the G7 in the coming days. Third, Mr Speaker, we also have an enduring commitment to all the Afghan people, and now, more than ever, we must reaffirm that commitment. Our efforts must be focused on supporting the Afghan people in the region itself, particularly those fleeing conflict or the threat of violence. We therefore call on the United Nations to lead a new humanitarian effort in this region. I’m very grateful to right honourable lady opposite because I think she’s asked a question that formed in many people’s minds about the 5000 And yes indeed the 5000 extra and the resettlement scheme and in addition to those already announced – we will support those people in coming to this country We will also support the wider international community in delivering on humanitarian projects in the region by doubling the amount of humanitarian and development assistance that we had previously committed to Afghanistan this year, with new funding, taking this up to £286 million with immediate effect. And we call on others to work together on a shared humanitarian effort, focusing on helping the most vulnerable in what will be formidably difficult circumstances. My Right Honourable friend makes an excellent point and that’s why the UK has chaired the security council of the UN, and asked to put the motion together with our French friends to get the world to focus on the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan And we’ll be doing the same thing in NATO, in the G7 and the other bodies in which we have a leadership role. We want all these countries to step up as he rightly says and focus on the most vulnerable in what we will be formidably difficult circumstances Fourth, while we must focus on the region itself, we will also create safe and legal routes for those Afghans most in need to come and settle here in the UK. So in addition to those Afghans with whom we have worked directly, I can announce today that we are committing to relocating another 5,000 Afghans this year, with a new and bespoke resettlement scheme focusing on the most vulnerable, particularly women and children, and we will keep this under review for future years, with the potential of accommodating up to 20,000 over the long-term. And so taken together Mr Speaker, we are committing almost half a billion pounds of humanitarian funding to support the Afghan people. Fifth, Mr Speaker, we must also face the reality of a change of regime in Afghanistan, and as President of the G7, the UK will work to unite the international community behind a clear plan for dealing with this regime in a unified and concerted way. Over the last three days I have spoken with the NATO and UN Secretaries General, with President Biden, Chancellor Merkel, President Macron, and Prime Minister Khan, We are clear and we have agreed that it would be a mistake for any country to recognise any new regime in Kabul prematurely or bilaterally. Instead, those countries that care about Afghanistan’s future should work towards common conditions about the conduct of the new regime before deciding, together, whether to recognise it and on what terms. We will judge this regime based on the choices it makes – and by its actions rather than by its words. On its attitude to terrorism, to crime and narcotics, as well as humanitarian access and the rights of girls to receive an education. Defending human rights will remain of the highest priority. And we will use every available political and diplomatic means to ensure that those human rights remain at the top of the international agenda. Mr Speaker, our United Kingdom has a rollcall of honour that bears the names of 457 service men and women who gave their lives in some of the world’s harshest terrain, and many others who bear injuries to this day fighting in what had become the epicentre of global terrorism, and even amid the heart-wrenching scenes we see today, I believe they should be proud of their achievements, and we should be deeply proud of them, because they conferred benefits that are lasting and ineradicable on millions of people in one of the poorest countries on earth, and they provided vital protection for two decades to this country and the rest of the world. They gave their all for our safety, and we owe it to them to give our all to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a breeding ground for terrorism. Because no matter how grim the lessons of the past, that future is not yet written, and at this bleak turning-point, we must help the people of Afghanistan to choose the best of all their possible futures, and in the UN, the G7, in NATO, with friends and partners around the world that is the critical task on which this government is now urgently engaged, and will be engaged in the days to come. 

Boris:


This is an extraordinary moment in your lives and your careers you have just completed one of the most famous and intensive courses of military training since the Spartans threw their recruits into rivers and I can imagine that in the last 44 weeks there have been times when some of you may have wondered fleetingly whether it has really been worth it when you’re yo-yoing 50 feet above the tarmac on a two rope bridge with nothing to break your fall when you’re tiger crawling through malodorous slurry like the final scene of the shawshank redemption when you are getting the hairdryer treatment from the RSM because he has detected a blemish in the sheen of your toecaps and he is casting doubt in front of the whole parade ground on your paternity and on the morals of your mother and I apologise to all loving parents here, but we must be frank about the kind of thing that is said on these parade grounds then you can be forgiven if for a tiny second you have said to yourself quietly stuff this for a lark and we know how exacting this course can be we know that Winston Churchill himself failed three times even to be selected for Sandhurst we know that on average one in six of your friends, fellow cadets, has dropped out and I am here on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the whole country to thank you for persevering because it is in those very moments of adversity and self doubt that resilience is forged You have learned something far more important than how to use kiwi and cotton wool and water to shine your toecaps or how to fire a gun because the face of battle has changed utterly since Sandhurst officers formed their men into scarlet squares at the battle of Waterloo and the weapons of war, you can see around you have changed beyond recognition even since I was a cadet I was trained on a Lee Enfield 303 that had been used at the battle of Mons and I will never forget the terror on the face of my instructor but there is one utensil that has not changed, one priceless skill that Sandhurst gives you and that is leadership the ability to inspire, to improvise, to rally, to think ahead constantly to put yourself in the shoes of others and to help bring out the best in them, not to make them believe that you can do anything, but that they can do anything and after 220 years in which British Armed Forces have found themselves engaged for good or ill in about 163 of the 193 countries in the UN and in which we have acquired and unbundled an empire seven times bigger than the Roman empire at its height we in this country are wise enough and humble enough to understand that the aim of our amazing armed forces should never again be conquest and the purpose of all our military professionalism should never be war, but peace and friendship and so it is fantastic that today there are soldiers from 22 other countries from Sierra Leone to the US and I wish you the very best in your careers and if you cannot all follow the example of one distinguished middle eastern leader who I am told has constructed an entire replica of a Camberley pub complete with bar staff I hope that you will look back fondly on your time here and in particular to the weather and to those of you who will be helping to lead the British army thank you for what you are going to do to uphold the values of this country freedom, democracy human rights the rule of law, bravery, perseverance in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world and in this country too when there are flood defences to be dug, when there are hospitals to be built and patients to be airlifted from remote Hebridean islands when there are vaccine centres to be constructed with lightning speed and thousands upon thousands of lives to be saved here in the UK we know that we can rely on the men and women of the British army and the leadership that has been acquired here at Sandhurst Thank you for sticking with it I am proud of you, your families are proud of you and I know that you are going to make the whole country proud of you Thank you very much and congratulations 

Boris:


Well, good evening, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you and congratulations to you all. Great to see you in person, by the way, isn’t it wonderful that the vaccines have liberated us to be able to come to this conference in London, a wonderful thing. Great to see you all, despite your masks, I see some familiar friends in spite of the masks, some of you have taken your masks off in a daring way,  but that’s absolutely fine - you’re socially distanced. Now listen everybody I want to thank you all for raising your hands, raising your hands high and then thrusting them deep into your pockets in the way that you are, producing this staggering sum of $4 billion going on $5 billion. We often go to summits, we did before COVID struck, and we’d see very often a lot of men in suits, let’s be clear men in suits basically saying that there was a problem before humanity that was so big and so intractable that there was no silver bullet, no quick fix, no simplistic solution.  Have you ever been in a meeting like that? Well, this is not that meeting. I want to say this GPE, this Global Partnership for Education, is completely different because this is the silver bullet, this is the magic potion, this is the panacea. This is the universal cure, this is the Swiss Army knife, complete with allen key and screwdriver and everything else that can solve virtually every problem that afflicts humanity. And I’m absolutely serious, if you educate the world properly and fairly then of course you end a great natural injustice. But also, if you end the injustice that nine out of ten 10 year olds cannot read a story around the country, 132 million kids aren’t in school or in many of the countries represented here, alas, there are too few girls in school, and there is a gross disparity, a gross disparity in the education of boys and girls.  If you end that injustice and you give every girl in the world the same education as every boy, 12 years of quality education, then you perform the most fantastic benefits for humanity- you lift life expectancy, you lift per capita GDP, you deal with infant mortality, and if you educate proper people properly in the way that they deserve then of course you end or you help to end all kinds of ignorance and prejudice and by educating people you help to end all the things that ignorance and prejudice help to create so you deal with terrorism and with war and extremism, and you help people to tackle climate change. And so I’m immensely proud of the achievements of this GPE Summit today, I’m proud of what the UK has been able to contribute in spite of the difficult financial circumstances that we’re all going through. We have lashed out 430 million pounds, as Julia rightly pointed out, the biggest sum we’ve ever contributed and I’m proud of the work we do around the world helping to educate young people across our planet, giving lessons in Hauser on the radio in Nigeria, I think it’s amazing to see what we do in South Asia teaching young girls in schools. Now I know, as Uhuru has said, that this pandemic has made things more difficult and we’ve lost ground and we all know the risk that inequality will now be entrenched but now is the time to make up that ground. Necessity has been the mother of invention, we’ve all learned how to cope with Zoom, some of us better than others. I think the younger generation probably are getting the hang of this electronic technology perhaps even better than some of us here in this room and they understand how to impart and imbibe information through the internet and I think we’ve got to make sure that we support through our GP, we support Edtech, we support the technical progress that we can make through laptops, through devices of all kinds, we should support the creation of infrastructure of classrooms, of course that’s the right thing to do. But never forget fundamentally what this is all about, what is education? Education is the imparting of knowledge of instruction by one human being to another. The people we really need to thank and the people we really need to think about are the teachers across the world. Everybody in this room will probably have somebody that you can think of that was the teacher who made the difference to your life, who encouraged you, who gave you confidence, can you think of one Julia? Mr Crow, there you go, well Julia would not be here without Mr Crow, let’s hear it for Mr crow. Uhuru, I seem to remember that lesson, do you remember that lesson we did with your kids. I owe a lot to all my teachers but I think in particular have a guy called Mr Fox, when I was about, I think about 10 years old, and he took me into the library and I don’t know whether he thought I was in need of remedial help, or whether he thought I had potential, it was never clear to me but he said to me I want you to read these books and it made a fantastic difference and a lasting difference to my life. I just want to say the best thing about this summit here today is that we are supporting with huge injections of cash those amazing people across the world who are inspiring young people to think that they can succeed. And they can succeed. And by the way let me give you one idea, someone somewhere, some child somewhere who is being supported by the over 4bn dollars, [what is it? there’s some doubt about this, oh it’s over 4bn dollars but going to be 5bn over 5 years] but some child somewhere may well be the one who goes on to develop the next vaccine to deal with cancer or whatever other problem afflicts humanity. Some kid around the world will absolutely no doubt have their lives transformed, many many kids will have their lives transformed by these funds and that is the objective- to unleash potential across the planet. It’s a fantastic thing that you’ve done, I’m very very proud the UK has been able to be part of it and with Uhuru with Julia to offer leadership. Thank you for coming to London, thank you for supporting the GPE, thank you for digging into your pockets and thank you for investing in education and young people across our planet, it is the single best investment we can make in the future of humanity. Thank you all. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, today we’ve reached the fourth step on our roadmap and I know that with cases increasing steadily and with more and more people being asked to self-isolate, there will, of course, be those who would rather that we waited weeks or months longer and kept social distancing and all the restrictions that we have been placing on our lives. And so I want to remind you all why I believe that taking this step now - however difficult it seems - and the logic remains the same that if we don’t open up now then we face a risk of even tougher conditions in the colder months when the virus has a natural advantage and we lose that firebreak of the school holiday. And there comes a point when restrictions no longer prevent hospitalisations and deaths, but simply delay the inevitable. And so we have to ask ourselves the question: if not now, when? And though both hospitalisations and deaths are sadly rising, these numbers are well within the margins of what our scientists predicted at the outset of the roadmap.  And so it is right to proceed cautiously in the way that we are. But it is also right to recognise that this pandemic is far from over. And that is why I’m afraid it is essential to keep up the system of Test, Trace and Isolate.  I know how frustrating it is for all those who have been affected – or pinged and I want to explain that people identified as contacts of cases are at least five times more likely to be infected than others. And even if they have been vaccinated there is a significant risk that they can still pass the disease on. And so as we go forward I’m afraid the continuing sacrifice of a large minority the continuing sacrifice of those who are being asked to isolate remains important to allow the rest of society to get back to something like normality. And, at this stage, it is simply a consequence of living with Covid and opening up when cases are high in the way that they are. As you know we will be moving on August the 16th to a system of testing rather than isolation for those who are double vaccinated by which time we hope that the wall of immunity in our country will be even higher. And, in the meantime, I want to assure you that we will protect crucial services including the staffing of our hospitals and care homes, the supplies of food, water, electricity and medicines, the running of our trains, the protection of our borders and the defence of our realm, by making sure that a very small number of named, fully vaccinated, critical workers to leave isolation solely for this work. But for the vast majority of us, myself included, I’m afraid we do need to stick with this system for now. And, of course, the only reason we are able to open up in this way at all, is that we have vaccinated such a large proportion of the population – and at such speed. It is phenomenal that every adult in the country has now been offered a first dose. But unfortunately that does not mean that every person over 18 has yet had a first dose. So far 96% of over 50s and 83% of 30-50 year olds have taken up the offer in England. But there are still 35 per cent of 18-30 year olds - 3 million people –who are completely unvaccinated. And though we can see the enthusiasm of millions of young people to get their jabs, we need even more young adults to receive a protection that is of immense benefit to your family and friends – and to yourselves. And so I would remind everybody that some of life’s most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination. There are already countries that require you to be double jabbed as a condition of quarantine free travel and that list seems likely to grow.  And we are also concerned – as they are in other countries – by the continuing risk posed by nightclubs. I don’t want to have to close nightclubs again - as they have elsewhere - but it does means nightclubs need to do the socially responsible thing and make use of the NHS Covid Pass which shows proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity – as a means of entry. As we said last week, we reserve the right to mandate certification at any point, if it is necessary to reduce transmission. And I should serve notice now that by the end of September - when all over 18s will have had the chance to be double jabbed –we are planning to make full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather. Proof of a negative test will no longer be sufficient. Let me stress - we want people to be able to take back their freedoms as they can today. We want this country to be able to enjoy the fruits of our massive vaccination campaign. But to do that we must remain cautious and we must continue to get vaccinated. And that is why we are asking you to come forward and get your jabs now. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s Levelling Up speech I wish I could tell you that this pandemic that we’re going through was over, I wish I could say that from Monday we could simply throw caution to the winds and behave exactly as we did before we had ever heard of COVID, but what I can say is that if we are careful if we continue to respect this disease and its continuing menace, then it is highly probable – and  on this the scientists are almost all agreed – that the worst of the pandemic is now behind us. There are difficult days and weeks ahead as we deal with the current wave of the delta variant there will be, sadly, more hospitalisations and sadly there will be more deaths but with every day that goes by we build higher the wall of vaccine acquired immunity, a wall that is now higher and stronger in this country than almost anywhere else in the world, and with every day that goes by our economy is slowly and cautiously picking itself up off the floor, businesses are opening their doors, you will see the employment figures this morning, people are slowly coming back to the office and over the next few weeks more and more people will find themselves back on their daily commute and as Andy Haldane of the Bank of England has said – there is every prospect that this country is poised to recover like a coiled spring and it is the mission of this government to ensure that in so far as COVID has entrenched problems and deepened inequalities – we need now work double hard to overturn those inequalities so that as far as possible that everyone everywhere feels the benefits of that recovery and that we build back better across the whole of the UK. We need to say from the beginning that even before the pandemic began the UK had and has a more unbalanced economy than almost all our immediate biggest competitors in Europe and more unbalanced than pretty much every major developed country and when I say unbalanced I mean that for too many people geography turns out to be destiny. Take simple life expectancy – even before covid hit, it is an outrage that a man in Glasgow or Blackpool has an average of ten years less on this planet than someone growing up in Hart in Hampshire or in Rutland why do the people of Rutland live to such prodigious ages? Who knows – but they do. There’s a glaring imbalance- or take university entrance- if you are a child on free school meals in London, you now have more than double the chance of going to university than a child on free school meals growing up outside London. It is an astonishing fact that 31 years after German unification, the per capita GDP of the North East of our country, Yorkshire, the East Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland is now lower than in what was formerly East Germany – and I remember going to former East Germany in 1990, just after the wall had gone down, and I remember being amazed at how far behind west Germany it then was a place of strange little cars with two stroke engines and fake coffee and yet we must be honest with ourselves – to a large extent Germany has succeeded in levelling up where we have not and it is vital to understand that these imbalances and inequalities are found within the regions of the United Kingdom– not just between them. A woman from York has on average a decade longer of healthy life expectancy than a woman from Doncaster 30 miles away – one stop away on the east coast mainline. In York nearly half the working population has a higher education qualification, in Doncaster that figure is only 25 per cent. Why is it that Leeds has 1 in 5 working age people not in work, while in Bradford next door the number is as high as one in three? Why should income per head in Monmouthshire be 50 per cent higher than in Blaenau Gwent? No one believes, I don’t believe, you don’t believe, that there is any basic difference in the potential of babies born across this country. Everyone knows that talent and energy and enthusiasm and flair are evenly spread across the UK, evenly spread,  It is opportunity that is not and it is the mission of this government to unite and level up across the whole UK not just because that is morally right but because if we fail then we are simply squandering vast reserves of human capital we are failing to allow people to fulfil their potential and we are holding our country back and so today I want to talk again about that project of levelling up and to define it more closely and in advance of a white paper later this year that will set out our plan to level up and we should begin by stressing – in all humility - that this is a huge undertaking that many governments have debated about and dabbled in before and though there have been some successes the overall results are disappointing and yet it could be so very different. We don’t need to look at what has happened in the old East Germany which has now overtaken parts of our country, we can look at our own history and the ability of places to recover and regenerate – without natural resources, without discovering gold or oil under their streets and we should never forget that our national capital suffered a 50 year period of decline when its population shrank by as many as two million people between the 1930s and the mid 1980s and the same urban decay was seen in cities around the country and the inequalities were so acute that when I became mayor in 2008 you could travel from Westminster to Canning Town on the jubilee line and lose a year of life expectancy with every stop and yet at the end of my time as mayor that was no longer true- life expectancy had increased across the capital – but the gains had been greatest among the poorest groups and that is what I mean by levelling up. There is much more to do in London, and there are still huge inequalities – but deprivation levels have been dramatically reduced and let us be clear about the difference between this project and levelling down. We don’t want to level down.  We don’t want to decapitate the tall poppies, we don’t think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer and you can’t hope to stimulate growth around the country by actually constraining companies from developing as the Labour government did in the 1960s, with the ludicrous industrial development certificates. Levelling up can only be achieved with a strong and dynamic wealth creating economy. There has got to be a catalytic role for government, and government is there to provide a strategic lead but that requires consistency from government – not chopping and changing - in the last 40 years we have had 40 different schemes or bodies to boost local or regional growth- we had the Abercrombie plan in London, the new towns, the economic development committees, the urban regeneration corporations, the new deal for communities, the regional development agencies, and yet none of these initiatives have been powerful enough to deal with the long term secular trends- de-industrialisation or the decline of coastal resorts and that basic half-heartedness has been coupled with an unspoken assumption by policy makers that investment should always follow success- so that to use a football metaphor the approach has always been to hang around the goal mouth rather than being the playmaker. Or to borrow from the Bible, for  biblical comparison, governments have created a sort of Matthew effect to him that hath shall be given so you end up investing in areas where house prices are already sky high and where transport is already congested and by turbo charging those areas, especially in London and the south east – you drive prices even higher and you force more and more people to move to the same expensive areas- and two thirds of graduates from our top 30 universities end up in London – and the result is that their commutes are longer, their trains are more crowded, they have less time with their kids, they worry at the same time that the younger generation won’t be able to get a home and that their leafy suburb or village will be engulfed by new housing development but without the infrastructure to go with it. And so the process of levelling up is not just aimed at creating opportunity throughout the UK, it is about relieving the pressure in the parts that are overheating and to those who seriously worry that levelling up could in some way be to the detriment of London and the south east let me make some obvious points and I speak as someone who has spent more than a decade now campaigning to extend the lead of London as the greatest city on earth. Does anyone really think it has been bad for London to have the BBC growing and flourishing in Manchester as well?  Is it bad for JP Morgan that they have a back office Bournemouth that is one of the biggest private sector employers in Dorset? That’s not bad for London. Of course not. And it is obvious that greater regional prosperity means more customers and more business for our national metropolis that already leads the world in financial and business services and so many other sectors of the 21st century economy, and so levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation, it’s not robbing Peter to pay Paul, its not zero sum it’s win win for the whole United Kingdom and so here is the plan for levelling up. And I believe we will have made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people’s sense of pride in their community. We’ve got to begin by getting the basics right, begin with fighting crime because we will never level up our country while some kids face the misery of dealing with the county lines drugs gangs, and some kids do not and that is why we are putting rings of steel around towns that are plagued by these gangs – and steadily driving them out and so far we have squeezed more than a thousand of these county lines out of business and that’s why we have tough sentences, we are recruiting 20k more police, and we will be ruthless in fighting crime because it is the poorest and most vulnerable who suffer the most, and to give kids alternatives to these gangs we will invest in grassroots sports of all kinds. And I can today announce another £50 m for football pitches so that we give new opportunity to the stars of the future and so that ultimately you are never more than 15 minutes away from a high quality football pitch and we won’t level up when so many people are sick, or off work because they are stressed, or because they suffer from obesity or problems with their mental health and that’s why we are tackling the problems of junk food and rewarding exercise and that’s why we are building 40 new hospitals and recruiting 50,000 more nurses, and we are going to deal with the backlog of those waiting for elective surgeries and the single biggest thing we can do of course, is investing in public services to change their lives to give them the confidence and the natural serotonin they need to deal with the day is to help them into a good job on decent pay and that means the private sector has to invest to create those jobs and we must create conditions for business confidence and when people look at the west midlands, here where we are today, the birthplace of the industrial revolution, the place that changed the world, they remember that – unbelievably – the number of private sector jobs actually fell three per cent under the last Labour government in the West Midlands, and they know that one of the problems holding the west midlands back has been the lack of mass transit, public transport, the basic difficulty of getting from your home to your place of work  and so that’s why I support the mayor’s plan to put in those new metro lines, and that’s why today I am fulfilling my promise to give eight city regions like the west midlands the funding to start making their bus and train networks as good as London by launching our city region sustainable transport fund with £4.2 billion that local leadership can spend on projects like contactless ticketing new tramlines, bike lanes – massively popular in this country, believe me as part of the biggest infrastructure investments in history. We are spending £640 billion on roads and rail, on housing and clean power generation and we will use the findings of Sir Peter Hendy’s union connectivity review to see how we can strengthen the sinews of the whole United Kingdom getting HS2 trains to Scotland and giving new impetus to projects that benefit the whole country the A1 that links Scotland and England, and the A75 that links Scotland and Northern Ireland, the links into wales along the M4 corridor and the A55 and dozens of other crucial and overdue projects like the A303 to the greater south west.
We have made huge progress in rolling out gigabit broadband throughout the UK. When I became Prime Minister almost exactly two years ago, 7 per cent of the country, that I never tired of saying at the time, had gigabit connection. By the end of the year we will be hitting 60 per cent and that has the potential to revolutionise our patterns of work and provide a tail wind for levelling up and no matter how frustrating we may find a life on zoom we can see how this technology – and its successors – will allow the places that have been left behind to become places that retain their talent, and professionals will be able to stay and bring up their families and enjoy a higher quality of life without the need to move to the supposedly fashionable conurbation and we are also helping young people to fulfil their dream of owning the home they live with our 95 per cent mortgage guarantee and reserving a portion of homes in some new developments for first time buyers at a discount of at least 30 per cent and this government is backing the improvement in the  lives of people growing up in those areas,  with the levelling up fund worth £4.8 billion – to be spent across the whole of Britain – England, Scotland and Wales and with town deals – with another 15 of them announced today, helping local people to renew they live from the civic square in Tilbury to the hippodrome theatre in Todmorden, removing chewing gum and graffiti, breathing new life into town centres through our new High Streets Strategy, published today and though each change may be small the overall effect can be transformed in making that environment attractive as a place to live and bring up a family and to invest and what is the key question that young families ask themselves about a neighbourhood- not just whether it is safe – but whether the schools are good and we need to give all our children the guarantee of a great education with safe and well disciplined classes and fantastic teachers  so we are literally levelling up funding for primary and secondary education, with a higher level of funding per pupil and so that every teacher starts on a salary of £30,000 and we must face the reality that in loss of learning, and loss of life chances, some children have been hit harder by this pandemic than others and so we have put in place the biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world to help them catch up, a catch up programme that is already worth £3 billion that was invested as soon as this government came in. But it is in post 16 education where the differences across our society are the starkest It cannot be right that Bath has 78 per cent with a level three or a level equivalent qualification and Bradford has only 42 per cent, and that is why this government is obsessed with skilling up our population. We love our universities and we believe they are one of the glories of this country but we need to escalate the value of practical and vocational education that can transform people’s lives. And that is why we are rolling out T-levels and apprenticeships because we know that higher level apprentices earn more than the average graduate five years after graduation. That’s why we’re creating the lifetime skills guarantee and so as we improve skills and cut crime and upgrade transport and ensure that gigabit broadband is probing its invisible electronic tendrils into every home in the land and opening limitless vistas of information and opportunity. By that process, we want to make the whole country more attractive for investment.
We are turning this country into a science superpower, doubling public investment in R and D to £22 billion and we want to use that lead to trigger more private sector investment and to level up across the country so that we have hubs or research and innovation like the one we are in today which is actually driving battery technology. This battery industrialisation sector is helping to drive battery technology and we’re going to need huge numbers of these batteries. We need 70,000 skilled individuals to be making the batteries alone. This battery development will drive investment from Cornwall to Thurso, so that without in any way detracting from the golden triangle of Oxford London Cambridge – the greatest scientific constellation anywhere in this hemisphere – we drive high tech high wage jobs across the UK and we will use new post Brexit freedoms – such as freeports – to drive those investments across the UK especially in green technology, from wind turbines to batteries we’ve seen being developed here today, to zero emission   planes to solar to nuclear power , hydrogen – all of which is set out in the ten point plan for a green industrial revolution and our new office for investment will land investments and continues to land investments in all parts of the UK, like– Nissan in Sunderland and the new gigafactory for batteries, Stellantis in Ellesmere port, Fujifilm in Teesside,  Ciner Glass in Ebbw vale – all just in the last few weeks. Not forgetting the wise decision of Heinz tomato ketchup to relocate back to Wigan from Holland and now is the time to scrutinise those incentives that we offer against those offered by other countries. Yes business already overwhelmingly chooses Britain and it was good to see the London stock market recover its edge over Amsterdam the other day. But now is the time to do even better and then there is one final ingredient, the most important factor in levelling up, the yeast that lifts the whole mattress of dough, the magic sauce – the ketchup of catch-up and that is leadership and this brings me to the crux of the argument- this country is not only one of the most imbalanced in the developed world, it is also one of the most centralised – and those two defects are obviously connected. We are making progress… we have created metro mayors, I used to be one, and the best of them are relentless champions for their communities like Andy Street and Andy provides the answer to the question of who you going to call in the West Midlands– if you are an EV pioneer- and you want a brownfield site and you want someone who can put together the transport, the skills, the utilities– then you know exactly who to ring- you ring Andy- and already after 20 years of trial and error we are starting to the see the results of this devolution. It is not entirely a coincidence that our great cities that had seemed to be in long term decline are now seeing a resurgence in population and a growth in productivity that outstrips the rest of the country and we need this levelling up to go much further and faster. Because the UK is outstandingly successful in spite of its handicap. If you look at France or other G7 economies the levels of productivity are much more comparable across all their big cities. Imagine if we could level up – not just lengthening London’s lead around the world. but closing the gap between London and the rest of the UK’s great cities. That would increase the national GDP by tens of billions, the opportunities for millions of people and then we should go further. The political geography of this country is as rich and as diverse and as idiosyncratic as the very landscape itself. The UK will never fit into some cookie cutter division into regions named after points of the compass. But where there are obvious communities of identity and affinity and real economic geographies – there is the chance to encourage local leadership and I want to return to this point. It is not just that this country is the most economically imbalanced – it is the most centralised. That’s because for many decades we relentlessly crushed local leadership and we must be honest about why this was necessary, it was because we were in the grip of a real ideological conflict in which irresponsible municipal socialist governments were bankrupting cities and were so genuinely hostile to business in such a way that government was forced to intervene. Now, with some notable exceptions that argument is now over and most of the big metro mayors know that private sector investment is crucial. They know that one of their jobs – for which they will be attacked in their local media – is to get on a plane and go to the big trade and property fairs and hustle for their hometown and today we want to go a step further, because if the big cities are beginning to catch up it is the rest of the country, those historic towns, our shires where local leaders now need to be given the tools to make things happen for their communities and to do that we must now take a more flexible approach to devolution in England. We need to re-write the rulebook, with new deals for the counties. There is no reason why our great counties cannot benefit from the same powers we have devolved to city leaders so that they can take charge of levelling up local infrastructure like the bypass they desperately want to end congestion and pollution and to unlock new job or new bus routes plied by clean green buses because they get the chance to control the bus routes. Or they can level up the skills of the people in their area because they know what local business needs, and they are working with them every day and of course you can see risk and the catch in all this, we have to learn lessons of the last 50 years. Ken Livingstone of the 2000s was a very different creature from Ken Livingstone of the 1980s, but the loony left remains pretty loony and we need accountability. As I say, we will not be proceeding with a one size fits all template. One possibility is a directly elected mayor for individual counties but there are other possibilities. We could devolve power for a specific local purpose like a county or city coming together to improve local services like buses. So my offer to you – and I am talking to all those who see a role for yourselves in this local leadership- come to us, come to Neil O Brien or to me with your vision for how you will level up, back business, attract more good jobs and improve your local services. Come to us with a plan for strong accountable leadership and we will give you the tools to change your area for the better, and it can be done, because there is no intrinsic reason why one part of this country should be fated to decline or indeed fated to succeed. The towns and cities that people say have been left behind have not lacked for human ingenuity, they have not been short of people with courage or intelligence or imagination, and there is no place in this country that does not have something special, something about their scenery or culture or history, some selling point unlike anywhere else in the world and they don’t think that they are left behind and they are right. They think that they are the future or could be the future and they are right about that too, all they need is the right people to believe in them to lead them and to invest in them and for government to get behind them and that is what we are going to do. 

Boris:


I want to set out what our lives would be like from the 19th of this month - which is only a few days away – if and when we move to step 4 - a decision we will finally take on the 12th - and I want to stress from the outset that this pandemic is far from over and it will certainly not be over by 19th. As we predicted in the roadmap we’re seeing cases rise fairly rapidly - and there could be 50,000 cases detected per day by the 19th and again as we predicted, we’re seeing rising hospital admissions and we must reconcile ourselves sadly to more deaths from Covid. In these circumstances we must take a careful and a balanced decision. And there is only one reason why we can contemplate going ahead to step 4 - in circumstances where we’d normally be locking down further – and that’s because of the continuing effectiveness of the vaccine roll-out. When we paused step 4 a few weeks ago, we had two reasons. First, we wanted to get more jabs into people’s arms – and we have, with over 45 million adults now having received a first dose and 33 million a second. That is a higher proportion of the adult population of any European country except Malta, and our expectation remains that by July 19 every adult will have had the chance to receive a first dose and two thirds will have received their second dose. And second, we wanted a bit more time to see the evidence that our vaccines have helped to break the link between disease and death. And as the days have gone by it has grown ever clearer that these vaccines are indeed successful with the majority of those admitted to hospital unvaccinated, and Chris and Patrick will show the data highlighting the greatly reduced mortality that the vaccines have achieved. So, as we come to the fourth step, we have to balance the risks. The risks of the disease which the vaccines have reduced but very far from eliminated. And the risks of continuing with legally enforced restrictions that inevitably take their toll on people’s lives and livelihoods - on people’s health and mental health. And we must be honest with ourselves that if we can’t reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal? And to those who say we should delay again; the alternative is to open up in the winter when the virus will have an advantage or not at all this year. And so again without pre-empting the decision on 12th July, let me set out today our five-point plan for living with Covid in the hope that it will give families and businesses time to prepare. First, we will reinforce our vaccine wall, reducing the dose interval for under 40s from 12 weeks to 8, so that everyone over 18 should be double jabbed by mid-September, in addition to our Autumn programme of booster vaccines for the most vulnerable. Second, we will change the basic tools that we have used to control human behaviour. We will move away from legal restrictions and allow people to make their own informed decisions about how to manage the virus. From Step 4, we will remove all legal limits on the numbers meeting indoors and outdoors. We will allow all businesses to re-open, including nightclubs. We will lift the limit on named visitors to care homes, and on numbers of people attending concerts, theatre, and sports events. We will end the 1 metre plus rule on social distancing, and the legal obligation to wear a face covering, although guidance will suggest where you might choose to do so, especially when cases are rising, and where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet in enclosed places, such as obviously crowded public transport. It will no longer be necessary for government to instruct people to work from home, so employers will be able to start planning a safe return to the workplace. There will be no Covid certificate required as a condition of entry to any venue or event, although businesses and events can certainly make use of certification and the NHS app gives you a Covid pass as one way to show your Covid status. Third, we will continue from Step 4 to manage the virus with a test, trace and isolate system that is proportionate to the pandemic. You will have to self-isolate if you test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace. But we are looking to move to a different regime for fully vaccinated contacts of those testing positive, and also for children. And tomorrow the Education Secretary will announce our plans to maintain key protections but remove bubbles and contact isolation for pupils. Fourth, from Step 4 we will maintain our tough border controls – including the red list – and recognising the protection afforded by two doses of vaccine, we will work with the travel industry towards removing the need for fully vaccinated arrivals to isolate on return from an amber country and the Transport Secretary will provide a further update later this week. Last, we will continue to monitor the data and retain contingency measures to help manage the virus during higher risk periods, such as the winter. But we will place an emphasis on strengthened guidance and do everything possible to avoid re-imposing restrictions with all the costs that they bring. As we set out this new approach, I am mindful that today is the 73rd anniversary of our National Health Service and there could not be a more fitting moment to pay tribute once again to every one of our NHS and social care workers. And the best thing we can do to repay their courage and dedication right now is protect ourselves and others and to get those jabs whenever our turn comes. 

Boris:


I’m very pleased to welcome Angela here on the last of the 22 visits you have made to the UK in your 16 years as German Chancellor. In the course of that time some things have changed beyond recognition, but for much of your tenure it was certainly a tradition, Angela, for England to lose to Germany in international football tournaments and I’m obviously grateful to you for breaking with that tradition, just for once. Nonetheless, one thing that has stayed the same is your commitment to the UK-Germany relationship. As you once said, we share the same values. And we share a lot more than that. Germany is the UK’s second largest trading partner, three-quarters of a million Brits work for German companies or vice versa. More than 21,000 Germans attend UK Universities and one in five people in this country are driving around in a German car. And today Angela and I have agreed to expand those links because we are expanding our youth exchanges, creating a new cultural dialogue and as we speak an energy superhighway is being established between our countries which will enable British tea to be brewed with the harvest of German sunshine and German Bratwurst will be grilled using British wind power. Angela you’ve just addressed the British Cabinet – I hope you enjoyed it- and you’re the first foreign leader to do so this century. And what we’ve also agreed is that from now on the German and UK Cabinets will meet every year to discuss shared issues in the first arrangement of its kind for the UK. Angela, on behalf of the UK, I want to thank you for your truly historic commitment to not just to the UK-German relationship but to global diplomacy more generally. I think over the last year, 18 months in particular, your scientific expertise has been instrumental in guiding the global response to the pandemic, and, as I was saying, a commitment to science and research is something our counties share and want to develop together. It is no coincidence that two of the world’s most successful coronavirus vaccines – Pfizer Biontech and Oxford-AstraZeneca – came out of German and British labs. I’m very proud that today we are establishing the new Herschel Medal for German and British women in Astrophysics in your honour – just one, Angela, of the lasting legacies of your leadership. It’s a great privilege to welcome you here today Angela, over to you. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on the G7 summit I chaired in Carbis Bay and the Nato summit in Brussels. Let me first thank the people of Cornwall, Carbis Bay, St Ives, for welcoming the representatives of the world’s most powerful democracies to their home, an enchanting setting for the first gathering of G7 leaders in two years, the first since the pandemic began, and President Biden’s first overseas visit since taking office. Our aim was to demonstrate how the world’s democracies are ready and able to address the world’s toughest problems, offering solutions and backing them up with concrete action. The G7 will combine our strengths and expertise to defeat Covid, minimise the risk of another pandemic, and build back better, fairer and greener, for the benefit of all. Alongside our partners, the G7 is now engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in history, designed to protect the whole world by the end of next year. My fellow leaders agreed to supply developing countries with another billion doses - either directly or through other channels - of which 100 million will come from the UK. The world’s most popular vaccine was developed here and the express purpose of the deal between the British Government, Oxford University and AstraZeneca  was to create an inoculation that would be easy to store, quick to distribute and available at cost price - or zero profit – to protect as many people as humanly possible. The results are becoming clearer every day: over 500 million Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines have been administered in 168 countries so far, accounting for 96 percent of the doses distributed to developing nations by COVAX, the global alliance that the UK helped to establish. With every passing hour, people are being protected across the world – and lives saved – by the formidable expertise that the UK was able to assemble. But all the efforts of this country and of many others, no matter how generous and far-sighted, would be futile in the face of another lethal virus that might escape our efforts. So the G7 has agreed to support a Global Pandemic Radar to spot new pathogens before they begin to spread, allowing immediate containment, and in case a new virus gets through anyway, our scientists will embark on a mission to develop the ability to create new vaccines, treatments and tests in just 100 days, compared to the 300 required for Covid. Even as we persevere against this virus, my fellow leaders share my determination to look beyond today’s crisis and build back better, greener and fairer. If we can learn anything from this tragedy, we have at least been given a chance to break with the past and do things better and do them differently. This time, as our economies rebound, we must avoid the mistakes we made after the financial crash of 2008 and ensure that everyone benefits from the recovery. The surest way of our future prosperity is to design fair and open rules and standards for the new frontiers of the global economy. So the G7 will devise a fairer tax system for global corporations, reversing the race to the bottom, and strive to ensure that new technology serves as a force for prosperity and hope, strengthening freedom and openness. My fellow leaders will act as one against an increasing injustice – the denial of an education to millions of girls across the world – by working to get another 40 million girls into school by 2025. I am happy to say that the G7 agreed to provide more than half of the $5 billion sought by the Global Partnership for Education to transform the prospects of millions of children in developing countries, and £430 million will come from the UK. Our duty to future generations compels us to protect our planet from catastrophic climate change and every country in the G7 has promised to achieve net zero by 2050 – wiping out our contribution to global warming from that date onwards – and to achieve that target we will halve our carbon emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. The G7 resolved to end any government support for unabated coal-fired power generation overseas, and increase and improve climate finance between now and 2025. We will consecrate 30 percent of our land and sea to nature, protecting vast areas in all their abundance and diversity of life, giving millions of species the chance to recover from the ravages of recent decades. And it is precisely because safeguarding our planet requires global action that the G7 will offer developing countries a new partnership – the Build Back Better World – to help construct new and clean and green infrastructure in a way that is transparent and environmentally responsible. There is no contradiction between averting climate change and creating highly skilled and well paid jobs, both in our country and around the world. We can and will achieve both, by means of a green industrial revolution at home and green infrastructure abroad.
I was honoured to welcome our friends, the leaders of India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa, as guests in Carbis Bay, virtually of course in the case of the prime minister of India. And on Monday, Scott Morrison and I were delighted to reach a free trade agreement between the UK and Australia, creating fantastic opportunities for both our countries, eliminating tariffs on all British exports  - whether Scotch whisky or cars from the Midlands and making it easier for young British people to live and work in Australia.
We’ve also included protections for British farmers over the next 15 years and unprecedented protections and provisions for animal welfare, and this House will of course be able to scrutinise the agreement, once the texts are finalised. This is exactly how Global Britain will help to generate jobs and opportunities at home and level up our whole United Kingdom. Our agreement with Australia is a vital step towards the even greater prize of the UK joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a $9 trillion free trade area embracing the fastest growing economies of the world.
Together with the G7, the countries represented at Carbis Bay comprise a Democratic XI, free nations living on five continents, spanning different faiths and cultures, but united by a shared belief in liberty, democracy and human rights. Those ideals were encapsulated in the Atlantic Charter, agreed by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt in 1941, when Britain was the only surviving democracy in Europe and the very existence of our freedom was in peril.
The courage and valour of millions of people ensured our ideals survived and flourished. Eighty years on, President Biden and I met within sight of HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy’s newest aircraft carrier and the linear successor of the battleship on which the original Charter was devised, and agreed a New Atlantic Charter, encompassing the full breadth of British and American cooperation in science, technology, trade and global security. The surest guarantee of our security is NATO, which protects a billion people in 30 countries, and the summit in Brussels on Monday agreed the wholesale modernisation of the alliance to meet new dangers, including in space and cyberspace, reflecting the priorities of our own Integrated Review of foreign and defence policy.
Britain has the biggest defence budget in Europe, comfortably exceeding the NATO target of 2 percent of national income. We have committed our nuclear deterrent and our cyber capabilities to the alliance and we contribute more troops than any other country to NATO’s deployment to protect Poland and the Baltic states. We do more for the security of our continent than any other European power, showing that we mean it when we say that an attack on any NATO ally shall be considered an attack on all, a pledge that has kept the peace for over 70 years, and which President Biden reaffirmed on behalf of the United States. Together these two summits showed the enduring strength of the Atlantic Alliance and the bonds we treasure with kindred democracies across the globe. They provided the best possible foundation for COP26 in Glasgow in November, when the UK will bring the whole world together in a common cause. They demonstrated how Global Britain creates jobs at home, while striving in unison with our friends for a greener, safer and fairer world. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


When we set out on our roadmap to freedom a few months ago, we were determined to make progress that was cautious but irreversible. And step by step – thanks to the enormous efforts of the British people and the spectacular vaccine roll-out we now have one of the most open economies and societies in this part of the world. And as we have always known and as the February roadmap explicitly predicted – this opening up has inevitably been accompanied by more infection and more hospitalisation. Because we must be clear that we cannot simply eliminate Covid – we must learn to live with it.  And with every day that goes by we are better protected by the vaccines and we are better able to live with the disease. Vaccination greatly reduces transmission and two doses provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness and death. But there are still millions of younger adults who have not been vaccinated and sadly a proportion of the elderly and vulnerable may still succumb even if they have had two jabs. And that is why we are so concerned by the Delta variant that is now spreading faster than the third wave predicted in the February roadmap. We’re seeing cases growing by about 64 per cent per week, and in the worst affected areas, it’s doubling every week. And the average number of people being admitted to hospital in England has increased by 50 per cent week on week, and by 61 per cent in the North West, which may be the shape of things to come. Because we know the remorseless logic of exponential growth and even if the link between infection and hospitalisation has been weakened it has not been severed. And even if the link between hospitalisation and death has also been weakened, I’m afraid numbers in intensive care, in ICU are also rising. And so we have faced a very difficult choice. We can simply keep going with all of step 4 on June 21st even though there is a real possibility that the virus will outrun the vaccines and that thousands more deaths would ensue that could otherwise have been avoided. Or else we can give our NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.
And since today I cannot say that we have met all four tests for proceeding with step four, I do think it is sensible to wait just a little longer. By Monday 19th July we will aim to have double jabbed around two thirds of the adult population including everyone over 50, all the vulnerable, all the frontline health and care workers and everyone over 40 who received their first dose by mid-May.
And to do this we will now accelerate the 2nd jabs for those over 40 – just as we did for the vulnerable groups – so they get maximum protection as fast as possible. And we will bring forward our target to give every adult in this country a first dose by 19th July that is including young people over the age of 18 with 23 and 24 year olds invited to book jabs from tomorrow - so we reduce the risk of transmission among groups that mix the most. And to give the NHS that extra time we will hold off step 4 openings until July 19th except for weddings that can still go ahead with more than 30 guests provided social distancing remains in place and the same will apply to wakes. And we will continue the pilot events – such as Euro2020 and some theatrical performances. We will monitor the position every day and if after 2 weeks we have concluded that the risk has diminished then we reserve the possibility of proceeding to Step 4 and full opening sooner. As things stand – and on the basis of the evidence I can see right now – I am confident we will not need any more than 4 weeks and we won’t need to go beyond July 19th. It is unmistakably clear the vaccines are working and the sheer scale of the vaccine roll-out has made our position incomparably better than in previous waves. But now is the time to ease off the accelerator because by being cautious now we have the chance – in the next four weeks – to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions more people. And once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated, which is what we can achieve in a short space of time, we will be in a far stronger position to keep hospitalisations down, to live with this disease, and to complete our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom. 

Boris:


This Summit was the first gathering of G7 leaders – in fact the first gathering of pretty much any leaders – in almost two years. And I know the world was looking to us to reject some of the selfishness and nationalist approaches that have marred the initial global response to the pandemic, and to channel all our diplomatic, economic and scientific might into defeating covid for good. And I do hope we have lived up to some of the most optimistic of hopes and predictions I should say I am sorry to hear that, owing to their pre-existing commitments, the England football team are not able to watch this press conference live in the way I’m sure they’d like to. But I hope that, following their resounding victory, they will be able to catch up on the triumphs of the G7 later on. A week ago I asked my fellow leaders to help in preparing and providing the doses we need to help vaccinate the whole world by the end of 2022. I’m very pleased to announce that this weekend leaders have pledged over 1 billion doses - either directly or through funding to COVAX – that includes 100 million from the UK, to the world’s poorest countries – which is another big step towards vaccinating the world. And that’s in addition to everything scientists and governments and the pharmaceutical industry have done so far to roll out one of the largest vaccination programmes in history. And here I want to mention, in particular, the role the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – the world’s most popular vaccine, developed 250 miles from where I’m standing today- by scientists who have rightly been given honours by the Queen this weekend. Today over half a billion people are safe because of the development and production of that vaccine, funded – I may add – by the UK Government. And that number is rising every day. It is popular, of course, because it is being sold at cost to the world and it was designed for ease of use in mind. And because of that act of generosity by AstraZeneca who, just to reiterate, are making zero profit on the production of that vaccine, millions more vaccines have been rolled out to the poorest countries in the world. In fact 96% of the vaccines delivered by the COVAX distribution scheme have been Oxford-AZ. But this weekend our discussions went far beyond defeating the pandemic. We looked towards the great global recovery our countries have committed to lead, and we were clear that we all need to build back better in a way that delivers for all our people and  for the people of the world. And that means preventing a pandemic like this from ever happening again, apart from anything else by establishing a global pandemic radar which will spot new diseases before they get the chance to spread. It means ensuring that our future prosperity benefits all the citizens of our countries and indeed all the citizens of the world. At the G7 Summit this weekend, my fellow leaders helped the Global Partnership for Education - an organisation working to make sure that every child in the world is given the chance of a proper education – reach half of its five-year fundraising goal, including a £430m donation from the UK. It’s an international disgrace that some children in the world are denied the chance to learn and reach their full potential, and I’m very very pleased that the G7 came together to support that cause. Because educating all children, particularly girls, is one of the easiest ways to lift countries out of poverty and help them rebound from the coronavirus crisis. With just one additional year of school a girl’s future earnings can increase by 20%. I’m proud that G7 countries have agreed to get 40 million more girls into school and 20 million more reading by the end of primary school in the next five years, and the money we have raised this week is a fantastic start. But of course the world cannot have a prosperous future if we don’t work together to tackle climate change. Later this year the UK will host the COP26 Summit, which will galvanise global action on fighting climate change and create a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. G7 countries account for 20% of global carbon emissions, and we were clear this weekend that action has to start with us. Carbis Bay is one of the most beautiful places in the world as you can see and it was a fitting setting for the first ever net zero G7 Summit. And while it’s fantastic that every one of the G7 countries has pledged to wipe out our contributions to climate change, we need to make sure we’re achieving that as fast as we can and helping developing countries at the same time. And what unites the countries gathered here this weekend – not just the G7 but Australia, India, South Africa and South Korea who have joined us (I should say in India’s case joined us virtually) not just our resolve to tackle climate change, but also our democratic values. It’s not good enough for us to just rest on our laurels and talk about how important those values are. And this isn’t about imposing our values on the rest of the world. What we as the G7 need to do is demonstrate the benefits of democracy and freedom and human rights to rest of the world. And we can partly achieve that by the greatest feat in medical history - vaccinating the world. We can do that by working together to stop the devastation that coronavirus has produced from ever occurring again. And we can do that by showing the value of giving every girl in the world access to  12 years of quality education. And we can also do that by coming together as the G7 and helping the world’s poorest countries to develop themselves in a way that is clean and green and sustainable I want to thank finally, the police, everyone who helped organised this summit and all the people not just of Carbis bay (who certainly helped us put the carbs into Carbis Bay), but all the wonderful people of Cornwall for their hospitality. It’s been a fantastic summit and I know that all the other delegations would want to express their thanks as well 

Boris:


Can I begin by welcoming you all here to Carbis Bay. It’s genuinely wonderful to see everybody in person, I can’t say what a difference it makes. You’ve all been going through the most wretched pandemic the world has faced for at least our lifetimes. I actually think that this is a meeting that genuinely needs to happen because we need to make sure we learn lessons from the pandemic. We need to make sure we don’t repeat some of the errors that we have made in the course of the last 18 months or so and we put in place what is needed to allow our economies to recover. They have the potential to bounce back very strongly and we have all sorts of reasons to be optimistic, but it is vital that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis, the last big economic recession of 2008 when the recovery was not uniform across all part of society. What’s gone wrong with this pandemic, what risks being a lasting scar, is the inequalities that have been entrenched. We need to make sure that as we recover, we level up across our societies - we need to build back better. I actually think that we have a huge opportunity to do that, because as a G7 we are united in our vision for a cleaner, greener world. A solution to the problems of climate change in all those ideas, in those technologies, that we’re all addressing. Together I think there is a potential to generate many, many millions of high wage, high skilled jobs and I think that is what the people of our countries now want us to focus on. They want to be sure that we’re beating the pandemic together and discussing how to never have a repeat of what we’ve seen. But also that we’re building back better together. And building back greener. And building back fairer. And building back more equal. Maybe in a more gender neutral, a more feminine, way. So those are some of the objectives we have before us today. Thank you all very, very much. 

Boris:


Good afternoon throughout this pandemic we’ve tried to keep people abreast of the last information as soon as we get it. And since I spoke to you last Monday, we’ve seen further clusters of the B.1.617.2, the variant first observed in India, we’ve seen it especially in Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen and some other parts of the country. At this stage there are some important unknowns. We believe this variant is more transmissible than the previous one – in other words it passes more easily from person to person - but we don’t know by how much. I am told that if it’s only marginally more transmissible, we can continue more or less as planned. But if the virus is significantly more transmissible, we are likely to face some hard choices. We are going to be learning a lot more in the coming days and weeks about that. The good news is that so far we have no evidence to suggest our vaccines will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness and hospitalisation. So that means we are in a different position from the last time we face a new variant before Christmas because of the scale of our vaccine roll-out, which PHE estimates has already saved almost 12,000 lives and prevented over 33,000 people from being hospitalised. So I believe we should trust in our vaccines to protect the public whilst monitoring the situation very closely. Because the race between our vaccination programme and the virus may be about to become a great deal tighter. And it’s more important than ever therefore that people get the additional protection of a second dose. So following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, we will accelerate remaining second doses to the over 50s and those clinically vulnerable right across the country so they are just eight weeks after the first dose, and if you are in this group the NHS will be in touch with you. We will also prioritise first doses for anyone eligible who has not yet come forwards, including the over 40s - and I urge anyone in those groups to come forwards as soon as you can. At this stage, there is no evidence of increased cases translating into unmanageable pressures on the NHS even in Bolton - and infections, deaths and hospitalisations nationally remain at their lowest levels since last Summer. So – and this is a balanced decision - I do not believe on present evidence that we need to delay our roadmap, and we will proceed with our plan to move to step 3 in England from Monday. But I have to level with you that this could be a serious disruption to our progress and could make it more difficult to move to step 4 in June, and I must again stress we will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe. Our surveillance and data gathering is now so advanced, that if there was a danger of the NHS coming under unsustainable pressure,
we would see the signs in the data very early on and could react in good time, and that gives us the confidence to continue moving forwards for now. But I urge everyone to exercise the greatest caution
because the choices we each make in the coming days will have a material effect on the road ahead. To those living in Bolton and Blackburn, I am very sorry that you are once again suffering from this virus. I know how hard it has been for you, having been in a form of national or local lockdown for longer than almost everywhere else. But now it is more vital than ever that you play your part in stopping the spread. We will not be preventing businesses from reopening on Monday, but we will be asking you to do your bit. Take the vaccine when you can. Get your free, twice-weekly rapid tests. If you do test positive, you must self-isolate – and we’ll provide financial support, to help to those on low incomes to help them do so. And as we move away from living our lives by government rules and as we learn to live with this virus, then, as I said on Monday, we need to make our own decisions about how best to protect ourselves and our loved ones - informed by the risks. And for those living in Bolton and other affected areas, there is now a greater risk from this new variant so I urge you to be extra cautious. Our best chance of suppressing this variant is to clamp down on it where it is and we will be throwing everything we can at this task. Colonel Russ Miller – Commander of the North West Region - will be deployed to support local leaders in managing the response on the ground. There will be surge testing, with mobile testing units, and the army will be on the streets handing out tests. And there will targeted new activity in Bolton and Blackburn to accelerate vaccine take-up among eligible cohorts – including longer opening hours at vaccination sites. And to everyone across the whole country, wherever you live, please get tested twice a week for free, get a jab if you are eligible, remember hands, face, space and fresh air observe social distancing from those you do not know, and if you are seeing loved ones think really carefully about the risk to them especially if they have not had that second dose – or it hasn’t yet had the time to take full effect. I want us to trust people to be responsible and to do the right thing. That’s the way to live with this virus, while protecting our NHS and restoring our freedoms. And it’s very clear now we are going to have to live with this new variant of the virus as well for some time. So let’s work together – and let’s exercise caution and common sense. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will update the House on our response to Covid. The patience and hard work of the British people has combined with the success of the vaccination programme to reduce deaths and hospitalisations to their lowest levels since last July, and from Monday, England will ease lockdown restrictions in line with step 3 of our roadmap. This will amount to the single biggest step of our journey back to normality. But after everything we have endured, we must be vigilant because the threat of this virus remains real and new variants pose a potentially lethal danger, including the one first identified in India which is of increasing concern here in the UK. So caution has to be our watchword. Our country - like every country – has found itself in the teeth of the gravest pandemic for a century, imposing heart-breaking sorrow on families across the world with more than 127,000 lives lost in our United Kingdom alone. And our grief would have been still greater without the daily heroism of the men and women of our National Health Service, the protection of our vaccines, already in the arms of over two-thirds of adults across the UK - and the dedication of everyone who has followed the rules and sacrificed so much that we cherish. Amid such tragedy, the State has an obligation to examine its actions as rigorously and candidly as possible, and to learn every lesson for the future, which is why I have always said that when the time is right there should be a full and independent inquiry. So Mr Speaker, I can confirm today that the Government will establish an independent public inquiry on a statutory basis, with full powers under the Inquiries Act of 2005, including the ability to compel the production of all relevant materials, and take oral evidence in public, under oath. In establishing the Inquiry, we will work closely with the Devolved Administrations as we have done throughout our pandemic response, and My Right Honourable Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has this morning spoken to the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and the First and Deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland to begin those conversations. Every part of our United Kingdom has suffered the ravages of this virus, and every part of the State has pulled together to do battle against it, and if we are to recover as one Team UK – as we must - then we should also learn lessons together in the same spirit. So we will consult the devolved administrations before finalising scope and detailed arrangements, so that this Inquiry can consider all key aspects of the UK response. Mr Speaker, this process will place the State’s actions under the microscope, and we should be mindful of the scale of that undertaking and the resources required to do it properly. The exercise of identifying and disclosing all relevant information, the months of preparation and retrospective analysis, and the time that people will have to spend testifying in public, in some cases for days, will place a significant burden on our NHS, on the whole of government, on our scientific advisers, and on many others. We must not inadvertently divert and distract the very people on whom we all depend in the heat of our struggle against this disease. And the end of the lockdown is not the end of the pandemic. The World Health Organisation has said that the pandemic has now reached its global peak and will last throughout this year. Our own scientific advisers judge that although more positive data is coming in and the outlook is improving, there could still be another resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths. We also face the persistent threat of new variants, and should these prove highly transmissible and elude the protection of our vaccines, they would have the potential to cause even greater suffering than we endured in January.
And there is in any case a high likelihood of a surge this Winter when the weather assists the transmission of all respiratory diseases and the pressure on our NHS is most acute. So I expect the right moment for the inquiry to begin is at the end of this period, in the Spring of next year, Spring 2022 Mr Speaker, I know there will be some in this Chamber and many bereaved families – who will be anxious for an Inquiry to begin sooner. So let me reassure the House, that we are fully committed to learning lessons at every stage of this crisis. We have already subjected our response to independent scrutiny including seventeen reports by the independent National Audit Office and fifty parliamentary inquiries - and we will continue to do so. We will continue to learn lessons as we have done throughout the pandemic. But no public inquiry could take place fast enough to assist in the very difficult judgements which will remain necessary throughout the rest of this year and the remainder of the pandemic. And we must not weigh down the efforts of those engaged in protecting us every day, thereby risk endangering further lives. Instead this Inquiry must be able to look at the events of the last year in the cold light of day - and identify the key issues that will make a difference for the future. Free to scrutinise every document, To hear from all the key players, and analyse and learn from the breadth of our response. That is the right way, I think, to get the answers that the people of this country deserve, And to ensure our United Kingdom is better prepared for any future pandemic. Mr Speaker, entirely separately from the Inquiry, there is a solemn duty on our whole United Kingdom to come together and cherish the memories of all those who have been lost. Like many across this Chamber, I was deeply moved when I visited the Covid Memorial Wall opposite Parliament, and I wholeheartedly support the plan for a Memorial in St Paul’s Cathedral, which will provide a fitting place of reflection in the heart of our capital. I also know that communities across our whole country will want to find ways of commemorating what we have all been through. So the Government will support their efforts by establishing a UK Commission on Covid Commemoration. This national endeavour - above party politics - will remember the loved ones we have lost; honour the heroism of those who saved lives and the courage of frontline workers who kept our country going; celebrate the genius of those who created the vaccines; and commemorate the small acts of kindness and the daily sacrifice of millions who stayed at home, buying time for our scientists to come to our rescue. We will set out the Commission membership and terms of reference in due course. And in telling the whole story of this era in our history, we will work again across our United Kingdom, together with the Devolved Administrations, to preserve the spirit which has sustained us in the gravest crisis since the Second World War, resolving to go forwards together, Mr Speaker, and to build back better. And I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I want to begin by thanking everyone again for your patience and for the sacrifices you’ve been making - businesses, pubs and restaurants that have been waiting to welcome customers back through their doors grandparents who have gone for months without seeing their grandchildren, weddings postponed, funerals sadly constrained, and religious festivals – such as Eid – yet again facing restrictions. And I want to thank you because your efforts have so visibly paid off giving us the time to vaccinate more than two thirds of all adults across the UK with more than one third – nearly 18 million people - also receiving their second dose – and thereby unquestionably saving many lives. So it is precisely because of your efforts, that I can confirm today we have met our four tests for further easing the lockdown in England. Chris will run through the details in a minute, but with deaths and hospitalisations at their lowest levels since last July, and the UK’s four Chief Medical Officers today agreeing a reduction in the alert level, the data now support moving to step 3 in England from next Monday 17th May. This means the Rule of Six or two households that has applied outdoors, will now apply indoors and the limit for outdoor meetings will increase to 30. From next Monday you will be able to sit inside a pub and inside a restaurant. You’ll be able to go to the cinema and children will be able to use indoor play areas. We’re re-opening hostels, hotels, and B&amp;Bs. We’ll re-open the doors of our theatres, concert halls and business conference centres and unlock the turnstiles of our sports stadia, subject to capacity limits. And from next week everyone will be able to travel within Britain and stay overnight, meaning schools will also be able to organise trips with overnight stays. We will no longer require face coverings in classrooms – or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. All remaining University students will be able to return to in-person teaching, where they should be tested twice a week. We will increase the number of named visitors for those in care homes from two to five, and residents will have greater freedoms to leave their home without having to isolate on their return. This unlocking amounts to a very considerable step on the road back to normality and I am confident we will be able to go further. Subject to the impact of step 3 on the data, we remain on track to move to step 4 on 21st June and to give businesses more time to prepare, we’ll be saying more later this month about exactly what the world will look like and what role there could be – if any – for certification and social distancing. And today we are taking a step towards that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid – when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts, and make our own decisions – based on the best scientific advice - about how to protect our families and those around us. So from next Monday we are updating the guidance on close contact between friends and family, setting out the risks for everyone to make their own choices. This does not mean we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. In fact, more than a year into this pandemic, we all know that close contact, such as hugging, is a direct way of transmitting this disease. So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones - whether they have had a vaccine, one or two doses, and whether there has been time for that vaccine to take effect. Remember outdoors is always safer than indoors. And if you are meeting indoors, remember to open a window and let in the fresh air. Keep getting tested regularly, even if you don’t have symptoms, so you don’t spread the virus without knowing it. And whatever you decide, I must ask that you continue to follow social distancing when not with friends and family including in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings. We only have to look at the very sad situation in other countries to see the lethal potential of this virus and we must continue to fight the spread of variants here in the UK. While we have no evidence yet to believe these variants are completely vaccine resistant, we must remain vigilant. So please remember hands, face, space and fresh air. And as we mark Mental Health Awareness week, perhaps also take a moment to check in on friends and family and see how they are doing after all that we have been through together, or if you are struggling yourself, get the support you need. Today we are announcing the single biggest step on our roadmap and it will allow us to do many of the things we’ve yearned to do for a long time. So let’s protect these gains by continuing to exercise caution and common sense. 

Boris:


I’d like to begin by thanking President Biden very much for bringing us together today in the way that he has and for setting out the problem in the eloquent way that he did at the beginning, and of course for returning the United States to the front rank of the fight against climate change. I’m really thrilled by the game-changing announcement that Joe Biden has just made. And I’m proud that the UK is doing the same. We were first country to pass legislation for net zero. We have the biggest offshore wind capacity of any country in the world, the Saudi Arabia of wind as I never tire of saying. We’re halfway to net zero. We have carbon emissions lower than at any point since the 19th century, we’re ending support for fossil fuels overseas and doubling our international climate finance. We’re actually speeding up because we see the obligations for developed countries to do more, we’re legislating to deliver 78% of the reductions needed to reach that goal by 2035. As host of COP26, we want to see similar ambitions around the world and we’re working with everybody, from the smallest nations to the biggest emitters to secure commitments that will keep change to within 1.5 degrees. And I think we can do it. And to do it we need the scientists and all of our countries to work together to produce the technological solutions that humanity is going to need.
Whether it’s carbon capture and storage or solving the problems of cheap hydrogen delivery or getting to jet zero flying, getting to net zero flying, making sure that we can roll out EVs properly, making sure that our homes stop emitting such prodigious quantities of CO2, moving to sustainable domestic living. We can do this together across the world. It’s going to mean the richest nations coming together and exceeding the $100 billion commitment that they already made in 2009 and I stress how important that is. Plus, I think what President Xi had to say about the harmony with nature was absolutely vital. If we’re going to tackle climate change sustainably, we have to deal with the disaster of habitat loss and species loss across our planet and we want to see even more examples of government and private industry working hand in hand as with the newly launched LEAF Coalition to reduce deforestation and the multi-trillion dollar Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. To do these things we’ve got to be constantly original and optimistic about new technology and new solutions whether that’s crops that are super-resistant to drought or more accurate weather forecasts  like those we hope to see from the UK’s new Met Office 1.2bn supercomputer that we’re investing in. I’m not saying any of this is going to be easy. There is obviously going to be a political challenge. It’s important to go back to the original words of President Biden, it’s vital for all of us to show that this is not all about some expensive politically correct green act of ‘bunny hugging’ or however you want to put it. Nothing wrong with ‘bunny hugging’ but you know what I’m driving at. This is about growth and jobs and the President was absolutely right to stress that. I want to leave you with the thought that we can build back better from this pandemic by building back greener. Don’t forget that the UK has been able to cut our own CO2 emissions by about 42% on 1990 levels and we’ve seen our economy grow by 73%,  you can do both at once. Cake have eat is my message to you. Let’s work together on this. Let’s go to Kunming in October and Glasgow in November armed with ambitious targets and the plans required to reach them. And let’s use this extraordinary moment and the incredible technology that we’re working on to make this decade the moment of decisive change in the fight against climate change and let’s do it together. 

Boris:


Thank you very much for joining us. I’m joined today by Dr Nikki Kanani. There is no doubt at all that this country is continuing to make progress in the fight against Covid. We are proceeding with our roadmap and I want to thank everybody for continuing to follow the guidance and to thank parents and families for the incredible work you are doing to help test pupils through the Easter holidays and to encourage you to keep testing them twice a week as schools return.
And above all I want to thank everybody involved in the outstanding vaccine roll-out especially those of you coming forwards in huge numbers as you are. 19 out of 20 of those who’ve had a first dose are coming forward for a second meaning that almost 1 in 5 of all adults have now had a second dose. And on first jabs we’ve now vaccinated 33 million people including 60 per cent of the 45-49 year olds. And we know that this vaccination programme is making a big difference. We know that it’s helping to reduce suffering and save lives potentially on a very big scale. But we don’t yet know the full extent of the protection that we are building up the exact strength of our defences – and as we look at what is happening in other countries with cases now at record numbers around the world, we cannot delude ourselves that Covid has gone away. I see nothing in the data now that makes me think we are going to have to deviate in any way from the roadmap cautious but irreversible that we have set out. But the majority of scientific opinion in this country is still firmly of the view that there will be another wave of covid at some stage this year and so we must – as far as possible – learn to live with this disease, as we live with other diseases. We will be bolstering our defences with booster jabs this Autumn, we’ll be continuing with testing, and today I want to announce what we hope will be a further line of medical defence. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to pioneer dexamethasone, which has saved a million lives globally. And today we are creating a new Antivirals Task Force to search for the most promising new medicines and support their development through clinical trials with the aim of making them safely and rapidly available as early as the Autumn. This means, for example, that if you test positive there might be a tablet you could take at home to stop the virus in its tracks and significantly reduce the chance of infection turning into more severe disease.
Or if you’re living with someone who has tested positive, there might be a pill you could take for a few days to stop you getting the disease yourself. And by focussing on these antivirals we hope to lengthen the UK’s lead in life sciences and to give ever greater confidence to the people of this country that we can continue on our path towards freedom. We have a taken a big step again this month, reopening significant parts of our country again, and for many people this last week has brought the first glimmerings of a return to normality having a pint, having a haircut, making that trip to the shops. Every day science is helping us to get back towards normality and I believe that antiviral treatments can play an important part. And if we keep going, follow the rules remember hands, face, space, fresh air – then we can keep each other safe and see through our roadmap to reclaim our lives in full.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s statement on the death of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh It was with great sadness that a short time ago I received word from Buckingham Palace that His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh has passed away at the age of 99. Prince Philip earned the affection of generations here in the United Kingdom, across the Commonwealth and around the world. He was the longest serving consort in history, one of the last surviving people in this country to have served in the second world war at Cape Matapan, where he was mentioned in despatches for bravery and in the invasion of Sicily, where he saved his ship by his quick thinking and from that conflict he took an ethic of service that he applied throughout the unprecedented changes of the post war era. Like the expert carriage driver that he was he helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life. He was an environmentalist, and a champion of the natural world long before it was fashionable. With his Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme he shaped and inspired the lives of countless young people and at literally tens of thousands of events he fostered their hopes and encouraged their ambitions. We remember the Duke for all of this and above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty The Queen. Not just as her consort, by her side every day of her reign, but as her husband, her “strength and stay”, of more than 70 years. And it is to Her Majesty, and her family, that our nation’s thoughts must turn today. Because they have lost not just a much-loved and highly respected public figure, but a devoted husband and a proud and loving father, grandfather and, in recent years, great-grandfather. Speaking on their golden wedding anniversary, Her Majesty said that our country owed her husband “a greater debt than he would ever claim or we shall ever know” and I am sure that estimate is correct. So we mourn today with Her Majesty The Queen we offer our condolences to her and to all her family and we give thanks, as a nation and a Kingdom, for the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I hope you’re all continuing to enjoy the Easter break, and I know that over this weekend millions of people have been able to see loved ones for the first time in months. And I want to thank you all again for your patience, because it is really clear now that this is paying off. And it your collective efforts, our collective efforts, that has given us that crucial time and space to vaccinate more than 31 million people. And I’m pleased that we’ve also been able to support our overseas territories so that Gibraltar has become one of the first places in the world to offer a vaccination to its entire adult population. And the net result of your efforts and the vaccine roll-out is that I can today confirm that from Monday 12th April, we will move to Step Two of our roadmap - re-opening shops, gyms, zoos, holiday campsites, personal care services like hairdressers and, of course, beer gardens and outdoor hospitality of all kinds. And on Monday the 12th I will be going to the pub myself - and cautiously but irreversibly raising a pint of beer to my lips. We’re also increasing the number of visitors to care homes from one to two – to allow residents to see more of their loved ones. We think that these changes are fully justified by the data which show we are meeting our four tests for easing the lockdown as Chris will shortly explain. But – and you know I’m going to say this – we can’t be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries and we’ve seen how this story goes. We still don’t know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise, as I’m afraid that they will – and that’s why we’re saying: Please get your vaccine or your second dose when your turn comes. And please use the free NHS tests – even if you don’t feel ill, because remember 1 in 3 people with this virus doesn’t have any symptoms - and you can get these tests from pharmacies or your local test site, you can even order them on gov.uk and get home deliveries. As part of our roadmap we’re also publishing today on gov.uk the early thinking on our four reviews, on the safe return of major events, on social distancing, the potential role of Covid status certification, and on the resumption of international travel. We set out our roadmap and we’re sticking to it. And I want to stress, that we see nothing in the present data that makes us think that we will have to deviate from that roadmap. But it is by being cautious, by monitoring the data at every stage and by following the rules: remembering hands, face, space and fresh air - that we hope together to make this roadmap to freedom irreversible. 

Boris:


Good afternoon and welcome to this press conference on what has been a big day for many of us – with the first chance to see friends and family outdoors, whether as six people or two households. And I want to congratulate the members of Ilkeston cycling club in Derbyshire that set off at midnight, the swimmers who broached the chilly waters of the Hillingdon Lido at the crack of dawn, and more than anything I know how much it will have meant to millions of people to have joined someone else for a cup of tea in the garden. And I must stress that it is only because of months of sacrifice and effort that we can take this small step to freedom today. And we must proceed with caution. It is great to see that yesterday we recorded the lowest number of new infections for six months deaths and hospital admissions across the UK are continuing to fall. But that wave is still rising across the Channel and it is inevitable as we advance on this roadmap that there will be more infections, and unavoidably more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths. So what we need to do is continue flat out to build the immunity of our population build our defences against that wave when it comes. And now that we have vaccinated more than 30 million adults across the United Kingdom it is more vital than ever to protect the most vulnerable. the evidence seems pretty clear that vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable has helped to drive down rates of hospitalisation and death and now we want to reinforce that protection with a second dose so for many people April will be the “Second Dose Month” and please take up your appointment when it’s your turn. And at the same time as we push forwards with our programme to offer a vaccination to all adults by the end of July we’re building up our own long-term UK manufacturing capabilities. I’ve already told you that Novavax – a potentially significant new weapon in our armoury against Covid - is going to be made at Fujifilm in the North East. And I can today announce that the Vaccine Task Force has reached an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to finish and bottle this precious fluid also in the North East giving us between 50 and 60 million doses of UK made vaccine subject to the right approvals from the MHRA. And then, of course, there is one other way we can all build our own individual defences against Covid and enjoy ourselves at the same time – and that is to take more exercise. So I am personally thrilled that I will be able to play tennis for instance And without being remotely preachy I do hope that we can take advantage of this moment and the beautiful weather – to play sport, to take exercise, to have fun and build our national resilience in that way too. And remember that outdoors is generally much safer than indoors and the way to continue on our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom is to follow the rules and remember hands, face, space and fresh air. 

Boris:


Good afternoon everybody, thank you for joining us, When I asked you to go into lockdown exactly a year ago it seemed incredible that in the 21st Century this was the only way to fight a new respiratory disease - to stay at home to avoid human contact to shun so many of the patterns of behaviour that are most natural and obvious to all of us. But we did it together to protect the NHS to save lives. And for the entire British people it has been an epic of endurance and privation, of children’s birthday parties cancelled of weddings postponed of family gatherings of all kinds simply deleted from the diary. And worst of all in that time We’ve suffered so many losses and for so many people our grief has been made more acute because we have not been able to see our loved ones in their final days to hold their hands or even to mourn them together. And at the right moment, we will come together as a country to build a fitting and a permanent memorial to the loved ones we have lost and to commemorate this whole period. For month after month our collective fight against Coronavirus was like fighting in the dark against a callous and invisible enemy, until science helped us to turn the lights on and to gain the upper hand. And I want to renew my thanks to everyone responsible for the astounding vaccine roll-out which has enabled us to protect more than 28 million people across the whole of the United Kingdom with a first jab and administer more than 30 million doses in total. And I want to thank everybody for their courage, your courage, discipline and patience. When people come to describe this epidemic to future generations, we’ll tell the story of the heroes of the NHS and social care of pharmacists, teachers, armed service personnel, shop workers, transport workers, the police and so many others. But in the end this was unlike any other struggle in my lifetime, in that our entire population has been engaged, and it’s thanks to all of you therefore that we can continue on our roadmap to freedom. We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of the vaccine to every adult by the end of July. And cautiously but irreversibly, step by step, jab by jab, this country is on the path to reclaiming our freedoms. 

Boris:


Our roadmap to freedom depends on the continued success of our vaccination programme, and so it is reasonable for people to want to be continually reassured not only that our vaccines are safe and effective but also that we have the supply that we need. So I want to address both points today especially in the light of concerns you may have heard in some other countries about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. First, the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has reviewed the evidence, as it does every week. They have confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID far outweigh any risks and people should continue to get their vaccine when asked to do so and June will say a little bit more about that in a moment. It’s also very important for our European friends that today the European Medicines Agency has come to a clear scientific conclusion and I quote - “this is a safe and effective vaccine.” We also saw yesterday the evidence from Public Health England that a single dose of either vaccine provides 60 per cent protection against getting COVID. and reduces the chances of hospitalisation by 80 per cent and the risk of death by 85 per cent. So the Oxford jab is safe; and the Pfizer jab is safe – the thing that isn’t safe is catching Covid – which is why it’s so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes. And as it happens, I’m getting mine tomorrow. And the centre where I’m getting jabbed is currently using the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for those receiving their first dose, and that is the one I’ll be having. And let me also assure you – if you come forwards after receiving your letter, we have the jabs for you. We’ve always said that in a vaccination programme of this pace and this scale, some interruptions in supply are inevitable and it is true that in the short term we are receiving fewer vaccines than we had planned for a week ago. That is because of a delay in a shipment from the Serum Institute who are doing a herculean job in producing vaccines in such large quantities - and because of a batch that we currently have in the UK that needs to be retested – as part of our rigorous safety programmes. So as a result we will receive slightly fewer vaccines in April than in March. But that is still more than we received in February and the supply we do have will still enable us to hit the targets we have set. That means that by 15 April we will be able to offer a first dose to all of you who are over 50, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable. We will have the second doses that people need within the 12 week window – which means around        12 million people in April. And we will still offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July. So there is no change to the next steps of the roadmap. We’ve now vaccinated over 25 million across our entire United Kingdom – more than the entire population of many countries and our progress along the road to freedom continues unchecked. We remain on track to reclaim the things we love, to see our families and friends again, to return to our local pubs, our gyms and sports facilities, and of course our shops, all as long as the data continue to go in the right direction and we meet our four tests. And the way to ensure this happens is to get that jab when your turn comes. So let’s get the jab done! Thank you very much. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement on the government’s Integrated Review of security, defence, development and foreign policy, which we are publishing today. The overriding purpose of this Review - the most comprehensive since the Cold War – is to make the United Kingdom stronger, safer and more prosperous while standing up for our values. Our international policy is a vital instrument for fulfilling this government’s vision of uniting and levelling up across our country, reinforcing the Union, and securing Britain’s place as a science superpower and a hub of innovation and research. The Review describes how we will bolster our alliances, strengthen our capabilities, find new ways of reaching solutions and relearn the art of competing against states with opposing values. We will be more dynamic abroad and more focused on delivering for our citizens at home. I begin with the essential fact that the fortunes of the British people are almost uniquely interlinked with events on the far side of the world. With limited natural resources we have always earned our living as a maritime trading nation. In 2019 the UK sold goods and services overseas worth £690 billion 
fully a third of our GDP, sustaining millions of jobs and livelihoods everywhere from Stranraer to St Ives -

and making our country the fifth biggest exporter in the world. Between 5 and 6 million Britons – nearly one in ten of us - live permanently overseas, including 175,000 in the Gulf and nearly two million in Asia and Australasia. So a crisis in any of those regions, or in the trade routes connecting them, would be a crisis for us from the very beginning. The truth is that even if we wished it – and of course we don’t– the UK could never turn inwards or be content with the cramped horizons of a regional foreign policy. For us, there are no faraway countries of which we know little. Global Britain is not a reflection of old obligations, still less a vainglorious gesture, but a necessity for the safety and prosperity of the British people in the decades ahead. I am determined that the UK will join our friends to ensure that free societies flourish after the pandemic, sharing the risks and burdens of addressing the world’s toughest problems. The UK’s presidency of the G7 has already produced agreement to explore a global Treaty on Pandemic Preparedness, working through the World Health Organisation to enshrine the steps that countries will need to take to prevent another COVID. We will host COP-26 in Glasgow in November and rally as many nations as possible behind the target of Net Zero by 2050, leading by example since the UK was the first major economy to accept this obligation in law. Britain will remain unswervingly committed to NATO and preserving peace and security in Europe, and from this secure basis, we will seek out friends and partners wherever they can be found, building a coalition for openness and innovation, and engaging more deeply in the Indo-Pacific. I have invited the leaders of Australia, South Korea and India to attend the G7 summit in Carbis Bay in June, and I am delighted to announce that I will visit India next month to strengthen our friendship with the world’s biggest democracy. Our approach will place diplomacy first and the UK has applied to become a dialogue partner of the Association of South East Asian Nations and we will seek to join the Trans-Pacific free trade agreement. But all our international goals rest upon keeping our people safe at home and deterring those who would do us harm. So we will create a Counter-Terrorism Operations Centre, bringing together our ability to thwart the designs of terrorists, while also dealing with the actions of hostile states. It is almost exactly three years since the Russian state used a chemical weapon in Salisbury, killing an innocent mother, Dawn Sturgess, and bringing fear to a tranquil city. I can announce that the National Cyber Force, which conducts offensive cyber operations against terrorists, hostile states and criminal gangs, will in future be located in a cyber corridor in the North West of England. And we will also establish a cross-government Situation Centre in the Cabinet Office, learning the lessons of the pandemic and improving our use of data to anticipate and respond to future crises. The first outcome of the Integrated Review was the government’s decision to invest an extra £24 billion in defence, allowing the wholesale modernisation of our armed forces and taking forward the renewal of our nuclear deterrent. The new money will be focused on mastering the emerging technologies that are transforming warfare, reflecting the premium placed on speed and deployment and technical skill, and my Right Honourable Friend the Defence Secretary will set out the details next week. Later this year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will embark on her maiden deployment, leading a carrier strike group on a 20,000-mile voyage to the Indo-Pacific and back, exercising with Britain’s allies and partners along the way, and demonstrating the importance that we attach to freedom of the seas. By strengthening our armed forces, we will extend British influence while simultaneously creating jobs across the United Kingdom, reinforcing the Union, and maximising our advantage in science and technology. This government will invest more in research and development than any of our predecessors because innovation is the key to our success at home and abroad, from speeding our economic recovery, to shaping emerging technologies in accordance with freedom and openness. We will better protect ourselves against threats to our economic security. Our newly independent trade policy will be an instrument for ensuring that the rules and standards in future trade agreements reflect our values. Our newly independent sanctions policy already allows the UK to act swiftly and robustly wherever necessary and we were the first European country to sanction the generals in Myanmar after the coup last month. In all our endeavours, the United States will be our greatest ally and a uniquely close partner in defence, intelligence and security. Britain’s commitment to the security of our European home will remain unconditional and immoveable, incarnated by our leadership of NATO’s deployment in Estonia. We shall stand up for our values as well as for our interests - and here I commend the vigilance and dedication of Hon Members from all parties. The UK, with the wholehearted support of this whole House, has led the international community in expressing our deep concern over China’s mass detention of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province, and in giving nearly three million of Hong Kong’s people a route to British citizenship. There is no question that China will pose a great challenge for an open society such as ours. But we will also work with China where that is consistent with our values and interests, including building a stronger and positive economic relationship and in addressing climate change. The greater our unity at home, the stronger our influence abroad, which will, in turn, open up new markets and create jobs in every corner of the UK, not only maximising opportunities for the British people but also, I hope, inspiring a sense of pride that their country is willing to follow in its finest traditions and stand up for what is right. With the extra investment and new capabilities of the Integrated Review, I believe the United Kingdom can thrive in an ever more competitive world, and fulfil our historic mission as a force for good, and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Good afternoon this has been a big day and an emotional day for millions of families up and down the country as children see – and play with – their friends for the first time in months. And although I know that some will have been anxious as pupils always are on the first day of term – I also know that the overwhelming feeling is one of relief. And we all know that the education of our children is so important that the greater risk now is keeping them out of school for a day longer. I want to thank all the teachers who have got their schools ready and who have been teaching throughout the whole period – whether that’s remotely or in person - your work has been astonishing. And I want to thank the parents and all those who have been teaching at home who have had to master Zoom who’ve had to communicate every detail of the syllabus from fronted adverbials to quadratic equations. And we all know that the burden has disproportionately fallen on women, often holding down jobs and providing childcare at the same time. So our job now as government is to build on your efforts so that from now on our school children not only catch up on lost learning but take the biggest possible step forwards with a concerted national programme for educational recovery. It is thanks to all of you parents, teachers, pupils – thanks to this huge national effort to keep kids at home that we have been able significantly to reduce the spread of the virus. And so today we have been able to take that crucial first step on what we hope is our cautious but irreversible roadmap to freedom Today allowing people to meet one-on-one outside for the first time in months, allowing care home visits to take place with all appropriate precautions. And this first step on the road map is made possible above all by our NHS which has now vaccinated more than one third of the entire UK population. And we take this first step with confidence because all four of the most vulnerable groups have not only been vaccinated in overwhelming numbers but it is now at least three weeks since they received their first dose and so they will be feeling the full benefits of the vaccine protection. We will continue on this roadmap but we must remember that today’s return to schools will of course have an impact on the spread of the virus and so at all times and as we decide on the next steps when we take them we will be driven by the data, and with the number of patients being admitted to hospital with Covid each day still around eight times higher than the lows of last Summer, it is more vital than ever to follow the rules. Hands, face, space, and please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


Good evening, Our extraordinary NHS has now succeeded in vaccinating more than 17.7 million people across the United Kingdom and nearly a year after the pandemic began This unparalleled national effort has decisively shifted the odds in our favour so that we no longer have to rely simply on lockdowns and restricting our behaviour and putting our lives on hold But with every day that goes by this programme of vaccination is creating a shield around the entire population which means that we are now travelling on a one way road to freedom. And we can begin safely to restart our lives and do it with confidence. But I want to be frank about exactly what that means and the trade-offs involved. The vaccines reduce the danger of Covid: they save lives and they keep people out of hospital. But no vaccine against any disease has ever been 100 per cent effective. So whenever we ease the lockdown, whether it is today or in six or nine months, We’ve got to be realistic and accept that there will be more infections, more hospitalisations and therefore – sadly - more deaths, just as there are every year with flu. Even if we sustained the lockdown indefinitely, which would itself cost lives and do immeasurable harm to our children, we would not be able to eradicate this disease. And that’s why it’s right gradually to replace the protection afforded by the lockdown with the protection of the vaccines, and our approach is to move with the utmost care, and advancing in four steps, each with a minimum of five weeks apart so we can fully judge the impact of each relaxation before we move on, and you can see the details of all of this on gov.uk. And we will be led at every stage by data not dates, and we will apply four tests: the pace of the vaccination programme; the effectiveness of the vaccines; the pressure on the NHS; and the risks of any new variants of Covid. And therefore as we look at the data today, I can confirm that two weeks from today – Monday 8th March – we will begin step one and schools and colleges across England will re-open and teaching in classrooms can start again.
All the evidence shows that schools are safe and the risk posed to children by Covid is vanishingly small.
But to offer even greater reassurance, we are introducing twice-weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils and asking them to wear face coverings for the rest of this term.
Students on practical courses can return to university, but all others will need to continue learning online and we will review the situation before the end of the Easter holidays.
We will allow breakfast and afterschool clubs to restart and among other changes on 8 March, you’ll be able to have a coffee on a bench or a picnic in a park with one person outside your household. And because we know how stressful this time has been and how people yearn to see friends and family if only fleetingly we will now go further and on 29 March, you can meet more of your friends and family outside, including in gardens – either as two households or subject to the Rule of Six. And then we will go to step two – which is no earlier than 12 April – when shops will return and re-open, hairdressers, nail salons will reopen pubs and restaurants will all be able to serve customers outside – precisely because we know the risk of outside transmission is lower. And then five weeks after that, no earlier than 17 May, we will go to step three and open all our hospitality sector to service indoors pubs, bars, restaurants, along with hotels and cinemas, and, subject to capacity limits, we will also open sports stadia, concert halls and theatres. And finally - provided we continue to pass the four tests - then from 21 June we will go to step four and say goodbye to most remaining restrictions: resuming large-scale events like business conferences and football matches, lifting the limits on weddings and reopening nightclubs. All of these steps will apply in England, and the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across our whole United Kingdom for the duration of the pandemic. I know there are some who would like to accelerate this timetable and I know of course there are others who would like to be more cautious and stay in the slow lane. I understand and sympathise with both of those points of view because levels of infection are still high and we must strike a very careful balance and always accept we must be humble in the face of nature. But also, we must accept that we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that have separated families and loved ones for too long, and threatened the livelihoods of millions, and kept pupils out of school. It is thanks to the roll-out of the vaccinations, some of them pioneered in this country that the balance of that judgement is now changing in our favour. And it is thanks to the vaccinations that there is light ahead leading us to a spring and summer which I think will be seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all and from which we will not go back. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a Statement on the roadmap that will guide us cautiously but irreversibly – towards reclaiming our freedoms while doing all we can to protect our people against Covid. Today’s measures will apply in England, but we are working closely with the Devolved Administrations who are setting out similar plans. The threat remains substantial, with the numbers in hospital only now beginning to fall below the peak of the first wave in April. But we are able to take these steps because of the resolve of the British public and the extraordinary success of our NHS in vaccinating more than 17.5 million people across the UK. The data so far suggests both vaccines are effective against the dominant strains of Covid. Public Health England has found that one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduces hospitalisations and deaths by at least 75 per cent. And early data suggests that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine provides a good level of protection, though since we only started deploying this vaccine last month, at this stage the size of its effect is less certain. But no vaccine can ever be 100 per cent effective, nor will everyone take them up, and like all viruses, Covid-19 will mutate.
So, as the modelling released by SAGE today shows, we cannot escape the fact that lifting lockdown will result in more cases, more hospitalisations and sadly more deaths. This would happen whenever lockdown is lifted, whether now or in six or nine months, because there will always be some vulnerable people who are not protected by the vaccine. There is therefore no credible route to a Zero Covid Britain or indeed a Zero Covid World and we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental well-being, and the life-chances of our children. And that is why it is so crucial that this roadmap should be cautious but also irreversible. We are setting out on what I hope and believe is a one way road to freedom. And this journey is made possible by the pace of the vaccination programme. In England, everyone in the top four priority groups was successfully offered a vaccine by the middle of February. We now aim to offer a first dose to all those in groups 5 to 9 by 15 April, and I am setting another stretching target: to offer a first dose to every adult by the end of July. As more of us are inoculated, so the protection afforded by the vaccines will gradually replace the restrictions and today’s roadmap sets out the principles of that transition. The level of infection is broadly similar across England, so we will ease restrictions in all areas at the same time. The sequence will be driven by the evidence, so outdoor activity will be prioritised as the best way to restore freedoms while minimising the risk. At every stage, our decisions will be led by data not dates, and subjected to four tests. First, that the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully; second, that evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths; third, that infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS; and fourth, that our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new variants of Covid that cause concern. Before taking each step we will review the data against these tests
and because it takes at least four weeks for the data to reflect the impact of relaxations in restrictions and we want to give the country a week’s notice before each change - there will be at least five weeks between each step. The Chief Medical Officer is clear that moving any faster would mean acting before we know the impact of each step, which would increase the risk of us having to reverse course and re-impose restrictions. I won’t take that risk. Step one will happen from 8 March, by which time those in the top four priority groups will be benefiting from the increased protection they receive from their first dose of their vaccine. Mr Speaker, all the evidence shows that classrooms are the best places for our young people to be. That’s why I’ve always said that schools would be the last to close and the first to reopen. And based on our assessment of the current data against the four tests,
I can tell the House that two weeks’ from today pupils and students in all schools and further education settings can safely return to face-to-face teaching, supported by twice-weekly testing of secondary school and college pupils. Families and childcare bubbles will also be encouraged to get tested regularly. Breakfast and afterschool clubs can also re-open - and other children’s activities, including sport, can restart where necessary to help parents to work. Students on university courses requiring practical teaching, specialist facilities or onsite assessments will also return but all others will need to continue learning online, and we will review the options for when they can return by the end of the Easter Holidays. From 8 March, people will also be able to meet one person from outside their household for outdoor recreation – such as a coffee on a bench or a picnic in a park - in addition to exercise. But we are advising the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable to shield at least until the end of March. Every care home resident will be able to nominate a named visitor, able to see them regularly provided they are tested and wear PPE. And finally we will amend regulations to enable a broader range of Covid-secure campaign activities for local elections on 6 May. As part of Step one, we will go further and make limited changes on 29 March, when schools go on Easter holidays. It will become possible to meet in limited numbers outdoors, where the risk is lower. So the Rule of Six will return outdoors, including in private gardens and outdoor meetings of two households will also be permitted on the same basis, so that families in different circumstances can meet.
Outdoor sports facilities – such as tennis and basketball courts, and open-air swimming pools – will be able to reopen and formally organised outdoor sports will resume, subject to guidance. From this point, 29 March, people will no longer be legally required to stay at home but many lockdown restrictions will remain. People should continue to work from home where they can and minimise all travel wherever possible. Step two will begin at least five weeks after the beginning of step one and no earlier than 12 April, with an announcement at least seven days in advance. If analysis of the latest data against the four tests requires a delay,
then this and subsequent steps will also be delayed to maintain the five week gap. In step two non-essential retail will reopen, as will personal care including hairdressers I’m glad to say, and nail salons. Indoor leisure facilities such as gyms will re-open, as will holiday-lets, but only for use by individuals or household groups. We will begin to re-open our pubs and restaurants outdoors and Hon Members will be relieved there will be no curfew and the Scotch Egg debate will be over because there will be no requirement for alcohol to be accompanied by a substantial meal. Zoos, theme parks and drive-in cinemas will re-open as will public libraries and community centres. Step three will begin no earlier than 17 May. Provided the data satisfies the four tests,
most restrictions on meetings outdoors will be lifted, subject to a limit of thirty. And this is the point when you will be able to see your friends and family indoors - subject to the Rule of Six or the meeting of two households. We will also reopen pubs and restaurants indoors along with cinemas and children’s play areas, hotels, hostels, and B&amp;Bs. Theatres and concert halls will open their doors, and the turnstiles of our sports stadia will once again rotate subject in all cases to capacity limits depending on the size of the venue. And we will pilot larger events using enhanced testing, with the ambition of further easing of restrictions in the next step. Step 4 will begin no earlier than 21 June. With appropriate mitigations, we will aim to remove all legal limits on social contact, and on weddings and other life events. We will re-open everything up to and including nightclubs, and enable large events such as theatre performances above the limits of step 3, potentially using testing to reduce the risk of infection. Mr Speaker, our journey back towards normality will be subject to resolving a number of key questions and to do this we will conduct four reviews. One will assess how long we need to maintain social distancing and face masks. This will also inform guidance on working from home – which should continue wherever possible until this review is complete. And it will be critical in determining how Parliament can safely return in a way that I know Hon Members would wish. A second review will consider the resumption of international travel which is vital for many businesses which have been hardest hit including retail, hospitality, tourism and aviation. A successor to the Global Travel Taskforce will report by 12 April so that people can plan for the summer. The third review will consider the potential role of Covid-status certification in helping venues to open safely but mindful of the many concerns surrounding exclusion, discrimination and privacy. And the fourth review will look at the safe return of major events. Mr Speaker, as we proceed through these steps we will benefit from the combined protection of our vaccines and the continued expansion of rapid testing. We will extend the provision of free test kits for workplaces until the end of June and families, small businesses and the self-employed can collect those tests from local testing sites. Mr Speaker, in view of these cautious but I hope irreversible changes, people may be concerned about what these changes mean for the various support packages, for livelihoods for people and for the economy. So I want to assure the House, we will not pull the rug out. For the duration of the pandemic, the government will continue to do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. And my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will set out further details in the Budget next Wednesday, Finally, Mr Speaker, we must remain alert to the constant mutations of the virus. Next month we will publish an updated plan for responding to local outbreaks, with a range of measures to address variants of concern, including surge PCR testing and enhanced contact tracing. We can’t, I’m afraid, rule out re-imposing restrictions at local or regional level if evidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a new variant which escapes the vaccines. Mr Speaker, I know there will be many people who will be worried that we are being too ambitious and that it is arrogant to impose any kind of plan upon a virus. And I agree that we must always be humble in the face of nature and we must be cautious but I really also believe that the vaccination programme has dramatically changed the odds in our favour and it is on that basis that we can now proceed. And of course there will be others who will believe that we could go faster on the basis of that vaccination programme and I understand their feelings and I sympathise very much with the exhaustion and the stress that people are experiencing and that businesses are experiencing after so long in lockdown. But to them I say that today the end really is in sight and a wretched year will give way to a spring and a summer that will be very different and incomparably better than the picture we see around us today. And in that spirit, I commend this Statement to the House 

Boris:


There is a habit of turning up at occasions such as these and announcing portentously that the West is locked in terminal decline, the Atlantic alliance is fractured, and NATO is in peril, and everything we hold dear risks being cast into oblivion. And that industry of pessimism has thrived recently, perhaps even in Munich. So without wishing for a moment to downplay the challenges and dangers we face, in the teeth of a global pandemic, let me respectfully suggest that the gloom has been overdone and we are turning a corner, and the countries we call the “West” are drawing together and combining their formidable strengths and expertise once again, immensely to everybody’s benefit. As you’ve seen and heard earlier, America is unreservedly back as leader of the free world and that is a fantastic thing. And it’s vital for our American friends to know that their allies on this side of the Atlantic are willing and able to share the risks and the burdens of addressing the world’s toughest problems That is why Global Britain is there and that is exactly what Global Britain is striving to achieve. I’m delighted to report that I detected precisely that willingness among my fellow G7 leaders when I chaired a virtual meeting earlier today. The shared goals of the UK’s presidency of the G7 are to help the world to build back better and build back greener after the pandemic and minimise the risk of a catastrophe like this happening again. We all have lessons to learn from an experience that none of us would want to repeat. At the last UN General Assembly, I proposed a five-point plan to protect the world against future pandemics and today the G7 agreed to explore a Treaty on Pandemic Preparedness, working through the World Health Organization, which would enshrine the actions that countries need to take to safeguard everyone against another Covid. I intend to bring together my fellow leaders, scientists and international organisations for collective defence against the next pathogen, just as we unite against military threats. The heroic endeavours of the world’s scientists produced safe and effective vaccines against Covid in barely 300 days. In future we should aim to telescope that even more: by drawing together our resources, we should seek to develop vaccines against emerging diseases in 100 days. Even in the early weeks of the pandemic, I hope that we in the UK resisted the temptations of a sauve qui peut approach and tried to keep the flame of global cooperation alive. We helped to establish COVAX, the global alliance to bring Covid vaccines to developing countries, and today Britain ranks among COVAX’s biggest donors, with the aim of supplying a billion doses to 92 nations, and we will also share the majority of any surplus from our domestic vaccination programme. When Oxford University and AstraZeneca began their momentous effort against Covid, their express aim was to design a vaccine that would be cheap to obtain and easy to store, so that it could be speedily administered by every country. Protecting ourselves also means tracking the virus’s mutations, and nearly half of all the genome sequencing of possible Covid variants, anywhere in the world, has taken place in the UK. Now we need to mobilise our shared expertise to create an early warning system for the next pathogen, enabled by a worldwide network of pandemic surveillance centres, and the UK intends work alongside the WHO and our friends to bring this about. If anything good can possibly come from this tragedy, we have at least been given the chance to build a global recovery on new and green foundations, so that humanity can prosper without imperilling the planet. To that end,  as you’ve just been hearing from John Kerry, Britain will host COP-26 in Glasgow in November and I’m delighted that America under President Biden’s leadership has rejoined the Paris Agreement. The UK’s aim will be to help to rally as many countries as possible behind the target of Net Zero by 2050. We were the first industrialised nation to adopt this goal and we have made it legally binding and published our plan for a Green Industrial Revolution to show how we will get there, so I hope that other countries will follow the UK’s example. But we can only address global problems alongside our friends, and extend Britain’s influence around the world, if the UK itself and our own citizens are safe, including from the terrorist threat we all face. The starting point of our Integrated Review of foreign, defence and development policy – which will be published next month – is that the success of Global Britain depends on the security of our homeland and the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area. If climate change and pandemics are silent and insidious threats, hostile states may seek to harm our people in direct and obvious ways, as the Russian state did with reckless abandon in Salisbury three years ago, only to collide with the immovable rock of trans-Atlantic solidarity, sanctions and coordinated diplomatic expulsions, an outstanding act of collective security, for which I once again thank our friends. If we are to assure our safety, our democracies need to strengthen their capabilities to meet the rigours of an ever more competitive world. And it is precisely for that reason, so that we can keep our people safe, by fulfilling our obligations to NATO and enhancing the UK’s global influence, that is the reason I have decided to bolster our armed forces with the biggest increase in our defence budget since the Cold War. The UK’s defence spending will rise by £24 billion over the next four years, comfortably exceeding the NATO pledge to invest 2 percent of GDP, and ensuring that we retain the biggest defence budget in Europe and the second largest in NATO, after the United States. We will focus our investment on the new technologies that will revolutionise warfare – artificial intelligence, unmanned aircraft, directed energy weapons and many others – so that we stand alongside our allies to deter any adversary and preserve the peace. This year, the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, will embark on her maiden deployment, sailing 20,000 nautical miles to the Indo-Pacific and back. On her flight deck will be a squadron of F35 jets from the US Marine Corps; among her escorts will be an American destroyer, showing how the British and American armed forces can operate hand-in-glove - or plane-on-flightdeck - anywhere in the world. But investing in new capabilities is not an end in itself. The purpose of the military instrument is to strengthen diplomacy and therefore maximise the chances of success. We do not wish to live in a world of unchecked rivalry or decoupling or obstacles to sensible cooperation and global economic growth. Nor are we concerned solely with trade: I hope the UK has shown by our actions that we will defend our values as well as our interests. In leaving the European Union we restored sovereign control over vital levers of foreign policy. For the first time in nearly 50 years, we now have the power to impose independent national sanctions, allowing the UK to act swiftly and robustly. Our first decision was to create a Magnitsky regime designed to punish human rights offenders. The UK then became the first European country to sanction senior figures in Belarus after the stolen election. We have now imposed sanctions on over 50 human rights violators, including from Russia, Myanmar and Zimbabwe. We have consistently spoken out against China’s repression of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province - and we will continue to do so. We have introduced new measures to ensure that the supply chains of UK companies are not tainted by the violations in Xinjiang. After China broke a treaty and imposed a repressive national security law on Hong Kong, the UK offered nearly 3 million of the territory’s people a route to British citizenship. We acted quickly and willingly – with cross-party support at home – to keep faith with the people of Hong Kong. Now that we have left the EU, Parliament has a greater say over foreign policy and this has only reinforced our national determination to be a Force for Good in the world. Britain is working alongside France, Germany and the United States in a trans-Atlantic quad to address the most pressing security issues, including Iran. And I sense a new resolve among our European friends and allies to come together and act again with unity and determination, and we witnessed that spirit after the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, as he recovered in a hospital bed in Berlin. While NATO was being written-off in some places, the supertanker of European defence spending was quietly beginning to turn, and while this delicate high seas manoeuvre is far from complete, and the vessel needs to alter course a good deal more, the fact is that NATO defence spending – excluding the United States – has risen by $190 billion since the Wales summit in 2014. When our allies on the eastern flank sought reassurance about their security, NATO responded by deploying a multinational force in Poland and the Baltic states and the UK was proud to make the biggest single contribution, leading the battlegroup in Estonia, showing that we mean it when we say that our commitment to European security is unconditional and immoveable. I believe that Europe increasingly recognises the necessity of joining our American friends to rediscover that far-sighted leadership and the spirit of adventure and trans-Atlantic unity, that made our two continents great in the first place. A new world is rising up around us, patterns of trade and commerce are changing, the global centre of gravity is moving eastwards, the technological revolution proceeds with blistering speed. But none of us should fear or resent these changes. Free societies are united by their faith in liberal democracy, the rule of law and free markets, which surely comprise the great trinity of human progress. Free countries – many of them located far beyond the geographical “West”, by the way – possess a boundless and inherent ability to release the talents and enterprise of their people to master and adapt to change. It is no coincidence that of the 10 most innovative nations in the world – as ranked by the Global Innovation Index in 2020 – all but one are liberal democracies. There is no reason why our countries should not be stronger and safer in 2030 – or indeed 2050 – than today, provided we share the burdens, compete successfully and seek out friends and partners wherever they may be found. I have invited South Korea, and Australia and India to attend the next G7 summit as guests, alongside leading international organisations. So let’s resist any temptation to bemoan the changes around us. Let’s build a coalition for openness and innovation, reaching beyond established alliances and the confines of geography, proud of our history, but free of any temptation to turn back the clock, and harnessing the genius of open societies to flourish in an era of renewed competition. Let’s respectfully dispel the air of pessimism that has sometimes attended our conferences. America and Europe, side by side, have the ability to prove once again the innate advantages of free nations, and to succeed in forging our own destiny. 

Boris:


Today the national vaccination programme continues to power past the target we set six weeks ago with more than 15 million people vaccinated across the UK. And once again I pay tribute to the astonishing efforts of everyone involved – the GPs, the nurses, the volunteers, the army and the pharmacists like Hardik Desai - who rallied local volunteers to vaccinate 3,000 people in his village hall in Ticehurst in Sussex, while keeping his pharmacy open - and of course I thank all of you who have come forward to be vaccinated. This is an unprecedented national achievement but it’s no moment to relax and in fact it’s the moment to accelerate because the threat from this virus remains very real. Yes, it’s true, we have vaccinated more than 90 per cent of those aged over 70 but don’t forget that 60 per cent of hospital patients with Covid are under 70. And although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don’t have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the spread of infection. We have some interesting straws in the wind. We have grounds for confidence. But the vaccinations have only been running for a matter of weeks - and while we are learning the whole time - we don’t today have all the hard facts that we need. And the level of infection remains very high, with more people still in hospital today than at the peak last April and admissions running at 1,600 a day. So we have to keep our foot to the floor. And I can tell you today that the next million letters are landing on people’s mats right now, offering appointments to the over-65s and we are also contacting all those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers. And if we can keep this pace up – and if we can keep supply steady – and I hope and believe we can - then we hope to offer a vaccination to everyone in the first nine priority groups – including everyone over 50 – by the end of April. And at the same time we will be giving second doses to millions of the most vulnerable within twelve weeks of the first. So this moment is a huge step forward but it’s only a first step. And while it shows what the country can do we must be both optimistic but also patient. And next week I will be setting out a roadmap saying as much as we possibly can about the route to normality even though some things are very uncertain. Because we want this lockdown to be the last. And we want progress to be cautious but also irreversible. So please continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you. 

Boris:


It is five weeks since we set ourselves the target of vaccinating almost 15 million of the most vulnerable people in the country, and the aim was – and is – clear to everyone. By offering the prospect of protection from Covid to everyone 70 and over, to all frontline NHS and care staff, to older care home residents and staff and to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, we can do the most, the fastest, to reduce the incidence of death and serious illness. And, with less than a week to go until the target date of Monday 15th, there is no doubt that we have made great strides, with just over 13 million people now vaccinated in our United Kingdom, including 1 in 4 adults in England, over 90 per cent of everyone over 75 and over 90 per cent of eligible residents of care homes for the elderly. But that still leaves nearly 2 million people – a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham – that we still hope to reach. And there are people across the country who for one reason or another haven’t yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it, wherever you are – you won’t be more than about 10 miles away from a vaccination centre. So, go online, or get someone to help you or simply pick up the phone and call 119. And let me appeal to the fantastic social care workers we all rely on to look after our relatives, our parents and grandparents. If you have not received a letter, please contact your employer and fix it up. And let me stress that these vaccines are safe and effective, and it was good to see the World Health Organisation today confirm its support for the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine for use in everyone over the age of 18 and, obviously, anyone over 65, and also supporting the 12-week interval between the two doses. Indeed, they say the longer interval provides greater protection. And the reason I make this appeal today, for people to come forward in those groups and get vaccinated, is not so we hit some numerical target, but to save lives, prevent serious illness, and so the whole country can take another step on a long and hard road back to normality. And, as the data comes in, I’ll be saying more about that – including setting out the roadmap – over the next two weeks. I think the people of this country absolutely understand the importance of protecting the most vulnerable first and that is what we are doing. And, if we can keep the pace up and keep the supplies of vaccines up, we hope to reach everyone in cohorts 1 to 9 by the end of April. And I want to thank all of those involved for their heroic efforts: the doctors, nurses, military medics, local authorities, transport planners, warehouse operatives, delivery drivers, countless volunteers, often working through the night or even digging out snowed-in vaccination centres, like the community effort at Alwoodley Medical Centre in Leeds last Saturday so GPs, nurses and their teams could deliver 1,200 doses that day. And I want to thank the millions of people who have received their vaccinations and, with cases still high and the pressures on our NHS still severe, I want finally thank everyone, all of you who are continuing to follow the rules and urge you once again to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, When Captain Sir Tom Moore decided to launch a national campaign in his own back garden raising more money and achieving more in his one hundredth year than perhaps any Centenarian in our history he knew instinctively which organisation he wanted to thank and support it was – and is – the NHS. And he was right. Because there are many people and groups responsible for the UK’s vaccination programme and we owe our thanks to our brilliant scientists, to Kate Bingham and the Vaccine Task Force which has procured over 400 million doses of seven different types of vaccine, to the manufacturers and the delivery drivers, the pharmacists, the military medics, countless volunteers, but to get this life-saving medicine into the arms of the nation at the kind of speed that we’re seeing we are relying on the doctors, nurses and all the staff of our NHS. And it is thanks to their effort – the most colossal in the history of our National Health Service - that we have today passed the milestone of 10 million vaccinations in the United Kingdom, including almost 90 per cent of those aged 75 and over in England and every eligible person in a care home. And with every jab and every day, we have more evidence about the effectiveness of these vaccines. New research from Oxford University suggests the protection provided by the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine kicks in after three weeks and lasts right the way through to the booster at three months. And research also shows that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine seems likely to reduce transmission to others. And even if these vaccines cannot make us invulnerable, and no vaccine has ever given 100 per cent protection to everybody the evidence increasingly shows that our vaccines achieve this crucial objective: to reduce death and serious illness from those major strains of Covid that have been subject to research. And in the days leading up to our review point in the week of the 15th of February we will be accumulating even more data helped by NHS Test and Trace – so that we can begin to chart a way ahead starting, if the data allow, with the re-opening of schools on March 8th. And I will be setting out as much as we can about that roadmap forward on February 22nd And though today there are some signs of hope the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high. And I am sorry to say that we have lost another 1,322 lives in the last 24 hours alone and our hearts again go out to every family that grieves. And the wards of our NHS are under huge pressure with more than 32,000 Covid patients still in hospital. And so tonight let’s clap together for Captain Tom at 6pm and let’s clap for the spirit of optimism that he stood for but let’s also clap for all those he campaigned for our brilliant NHS staff and care workers and let’s do everything we can to carry on supporting them. Because if we stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives, then in the words of Captain Tom - tomorrow will be a good day. 

Boris:


When we look at the toll of this pandemic it must be measured not only in the tragic loss of life that we have endured with over 100,000 deaths and once again I offer my condolences to the families and friends of everybody who has lost loved ones - but I’m afraid we must also remember not just the damage to the economy, but the lost weeks and months of education and the real risk of damage to the prospects of our young people. And so I share very much the frustration of pupils and teachers who today want nothing more than to get back to the classroom. And I understand the stress and the anxieties of parents coping heroically with the pressures of homeschooling. And I know that everybody across the country wants us to get schools open as fast as possible And I can assure you that is the ambition of this Government. But I also know, we all know, that with 37,000 people in hospital suffering from covid and the infection rates still forbiddingly high you, we all, must be cautious and we all want only to open schools when we can be sure that this will not cause another huge surge in the disease. Because the problem is not that schools are unsafe teachers and headteachers have worked heroically to make sure that they are safe, that they are covid secure The problem is that by definition, schools bring many households together And that contributes to the spread of the virus within the community, and drives up the R. And so it follows that if we are to get schools open – and keep them open – which is what we all want then we need to be clear about certain things. We need to be sure the vaccine roll-out is continuing to be successful as it is and most important, we need to see the impact of our vaccines on those graphs of mortality, we need to see that they really are saving lives and preventing people from becoming seriously ill. Now we are confident that will happen and vaccines will have that effect but to be responsible we must see the proof. And our current estimates say that the proof will only become visible in the middle of February. And since we need to give schools two weeks’ notice to re-open it is sensible now to serve notice that we will not be able to re-open schools immediately after half-term on 22nd February. But if we continue to make the progress that we want to see, and that we believe we can see, Then we hope to begin opening schools on Monday 8th March. And to help parents and teachers with this extended period of remote learning We will extend the arrangements for providing free school meals for those eligible children not in school including food parcels and the national voucher scheme – until those pupils have returned to the classroom. And as we did this financial year, we will provide a catch-up programme over the next financial year, with a further £300 million of new money to schools for tutoring, and we will work with the education sector to develop, wherever appropriate, specific initiatives for summer schools as well as a Covid Premium for catch-up and to support pupils to catch up We will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure all pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament, so we tackle that issue of differential learning and kids who may have fallen behind through no fault of their own And so with every jab that goes in we are becoming more confident that we will reach our target of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And at that moment we will be able to review our progress, judge the state of the pandemic, and the effectiveness of the vaccine, and then in the week beginning 22nd February we will set out our plan not just for re-opening our schools but gradually to re-open our economy and our society and to get our lives back to as close to normal as possible. Now this will be a timetable that is inevitably going to be subject to adjustment But I believe it will provide clarity and certainty about the way ahead, a roadmap that we can take together and use as a country to defeat the virus and begin steadily to reclaim our lives. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement on the Government’s measures to safeguard our United Kingdom against the new variants of Covid until we have administered enough vaccinations to free ourselves from the virus. And I am acutely conscious that at this moment, parents are balancing the demands of working from home with supporting the education of their children, businesspeople are enduring the sight of their shops or restaurants or other enterprises standing empty and idle and, sadly, too many are coping with the anxiety of illness or tragedy of bereavement. I am deeply sorry to say that the number of people that have taken from us has surpassed 100,000, as the house was discussing only an hour or so ago, and I know the House will join me in offering condolences to all those who have lost loved ones. The most important thing we can do to honour their memory is to persevere against this virus with ever greater resolve, and that is why we have launched the biggest vaccination programme in British history. Three weeks ago, I reported that the UK had immunised 1.3 million people; now that figure has multiplied more than fivefold to exceed 6.8 million people, more than any other country in Europe and over 13 per cent of the entire adult population. In England we have now delivered first doses to over four-fifths of those aged 80 or over, and over half of those aged between 75 and 79 and three quarters of elderly care home residents And though it remains an exacting target, we are on track to achieve our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. I can also reassure the House that all current evidence shows that both the vaccines we are administering remain effective against the new variant that was first identified in London and the South East by means of our world-leading capability in genomic sequencing. The UK has now sequenced over half of all COVID-19 viral genomes that have been submitted to the global database, 10 times more than any other country. And yesterday, my Rt Hon Friend the Health Secretary announced our New Variant Assessment Platform, through which we will work with the World Health Organisation to offer our expertise to help other countries, because a new variant anywhere poses a potential threat everywhere. To guard against this danger, we must also take additional steps to strengthen our borders to stop those strains from entering the UK. We have already temporarily closed all travel corridors and we are already requiring anyone coming to this country to have proof of a negative Covid test taken in the 72 hours before leaving. They must also complete a Passenger Locator Form which must be checked before they board - and then quarantine on arrival for ten days. I want to make clear that under the stay at home regulations it is illegal to leave home to travel abroad for leisure purposes and we will enforce this at ports and airports by asking people why they are leaving and instructing them to return home if they do not have a valid reason to travel. We have also banned all travel from 22 countries where there is a risk of known variants including South Africa, Portugal and South American nations, and in order to reduce the risk posed by UK nationals and residents returning home from these countries,I can announce that we will require all such arrivals who cannot be refused entry to isolate in government-provided accommodation - such as hotels - for ten days without exception.
They will be met at the airport and transported directly into quarantine. The Department for Health and Social Care is working to establish these facilities as quickly as possible and my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary will set out the details of our plans in her statement shortly. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has this morning spoken to the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and the First and deputy First Ministers of Northern Ireland and, as we have throughout the pandemic, we will be working closely with the DAs to implement these new measures so that, where possible, we continue to take a UK-wide approach. Mr Speaker, it was the emergence of a new variant – up to 70 per cent more transmissible –  that forced England back into lockdown, and I know everyone yearns to know how much longer we must endure these restrictions, with all their consequences for jobs, livelihoods and most tragically of all, the life chances of our children. We will not persist for a day longer than is necessary, but nor can we relax too soon, because if we do we run the risk of our NHS coming under still greater pressure, compelling us to re-impose every restriction and sustain those restrictions for longer. So far, our efforts do appear to have reduced the R rate, but we do not yet have enough data to know exactly how soon it will be safe to reopen our society and economy. At this point, we do not have enough data to judge the full effect of vaccines in blocking transmission nor the extent and speed with which the vaccines will reduce hospitalisations and deaths, nor how quickly the combination of vaccinations and the lockdown can be expected to ease the pressure on the NHS. What we do know is that we remain in a perilous situation, with more than 37,000 patients now in hospital with Covid, almost double the peak of the first wave. But the overall picture should be clearer by mid-February: by then, we will know much more about the effect of vaccines in preventing hospitalisations and deaths, using data from the UK but also other nations like Israel.
We will know how successful the current restrictions have been in driving down infections. We will also know how many people are still in hospital with Covid, which we simply can’t predict with certainty today. So we will then be in a better position to chart a course out of lockdown, without risking a further surge that would overwhelm the NHS. When I announced the lockdown I said we would review its measures in mid-February, once the most vulnerable had been offered the first dose of the vaccine. So I can tell the House that when Parliament returns from Recess in the week commencing 22nd February subject to the full agreement of the House, Mr Speaker, we intend to set out the results of that review and publish our plan for taking the country out of lockdown. That plan will, of course, depend on the continued success of our vaccination programme, the capacity of the NHS, and on deaths falling at the pace we would expect as more people are inoculated. Our aim will be to set out a gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way, guided by the principles we have observed throughout the pandemic, beginning with the most important principle of all: that re-opening schools must be our national priority and the first sign of normality beginning to return should be pupils going back to their classrooms. I know how parents and teachers need as much certainty as possible, including two weeks’ notice of the return of face-to-face teaching. So I must inform the House that, for the reasons I have outlined, it will not be possible to re-open schools immediately after the February half term. I know how frustrating that will be for pupils and teachers who want nothing more than to get back in the classroom and for parents and carers who have spent so many months juggling their day jobs not only with home schooling but with meeting the myriad other demands of their children from breakfast until bedtime.
And I know too the worries we all share about the mental health of our young people during this prolonged period of being stuck at home. So our plan for leaving the lockdown will set out our approach towards re-opening schools. If we achieve our target of vaccinating everyone in the four most vulnerable groups with their first dose by 15 February – and every passing day sees more progress towards that goal – then those groups will have developed immunity from the virus by about three weeks later, that is by 8 March. We hope it will therefore be safe to commence the reopening of schools from Monday 8 March, with other economic and social restrictions being removed thereafter as and when the data permits – then or thereafter, I should say, Mr Speaker. As we are extending the period of remote learning beyond the middle of February, I can confirm that the government will prolong arrangements for providing free school meals for those eligible children not in school – including food parcels and the national voucher scheme – until they have returned to the classroom.
We can also commit now that, as we did this financial year, we will provide a programme of catch up over the next financial year. This will involve a further £300m of new money to schools for tutoring and we will work in collaboration with the education sector to develop, as appropriate, specific initiatives for summer schools and a Covid Premium to support catch up. But we recognise that these extended school closures have had a huge impact on children’s learning which will take more than a year to make up. So we will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their learning over the course of this Parliament. I know, Mr Speaker, that the measures I am setting out today will be deeply frustrating to many honourable friends and colleagues, and disappointing for all of us. But the way forward has been clear ever since the vaccines arrived and, as we inoculate more people hour by hour, this is the time to hold our nerve in the endgame of the battle against the virus. Our goal now must be to buy the extra weeks we need to immunise the most vulnerable and get this virus under control, so that together we can defeat this most wretched disease, reclaim our lives once and for all, and, Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


I am sorry to have to tell you that today the number of deaths recorded from Covid in the UK has surpassed 100,000, and it is hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic. The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye. I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one: fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken. And, to all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others. We will remember the courage of countless working people – not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others – who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War. We will commemorate the small acts of kindness, the spirit of volunteering and the daily sacrifice of millions who placed their lives on hold time and again as we fought each new wave of the virus, buying time for our brilliant scientists to come to our aid. In that moment of commemoration, we will celebrate the genius and perseverance of those who discovered the vaccines and the immense national effort – never seen before in our history – which is now underway to distribute them, one that has now seen us immunise over 6.8 million people across the United Kingdom. And when those vaccines have finally freed us from this virus and put us on a path to recovery, we will make sure that we learn the lessons and reflect and prepare. And, until that time, the best and most important thing we can all do to honour the memory of those who have died is to work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease. And that is what we will do. 

Boris:


Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have tried to update you as soon as possible about changes in the scientific data or the analysis. So, I must tell you this afternoon that we have been informed today that, in addition to spreading more quickly, it also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant – the variant that was first identified in London and the South East – may be associated with a higher degree of mortality, and I’m going to ask Patrick in a minute to say a bit more about that. Because it is largely the impact of this new variant that means the NHS is under such intense pressure, with another 40,261 positive cases since yesterday. We have 38,562 COVID patients now in hospital, that’s 78 per cent higher than the first peak in April and, tragically, there have been a further 1,401 deaths. So, it is more important than ever that we all remain vigilant in following the rules and that we stay at home, protect the NHS and thereby save lives. But I also want to answer a key question that I know will be uppermost in your minds. All current evidence continues to show that both the vaccines we are currently using remain effective both against the old variant and this new variant. And so, you will also want to know that our immunisation programme continues at an unprecedented rate. 5.4 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of the vaccine and over the last 24 hours we can report a record 400,000 vaccinations. In England one in ten of all adults have received their first dose, including 71 per cent of over-80s and two thirds of elderly care home residents. Having secured orders for hundreds of millions of doses, the U.K. government has supplied vaccines to the Devolved Administrations, according to population size. First doses have been administered now to 151,000 people in Northern Ireland, 358,000 in Scotland and 212,000 in Wales. And I am glad that the whole of the U.K. is able to assist the Devolved Administrations in deploying the vaccine and I know everyone across the country is grateful for the logistical skill of the British Army. There is much more to do, and the target remains very stretching indeed, but we remain on track to reach our goal of offering a first dose to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. And I want to thank all the doctors and nurses, especially at the GP-led sites who are vaccinating at a phenomenal rate, as well as, as I say, all those in our armed forces, our local authorities, our pharmacies and volunteers, who are making this extraordinary national effort possible. And I want to thank all of you who have come forward to get your jabs, because, by doing that, you are protecting yourselves, your communities and, of course, our NHS. And I say to everyone, when that letter arrives, please don’t hesitate to book that appointment and get this life-saving protection, because this is the best and fastest way for us all to defeat this virus and get our lives back to normal. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 15 January 2021 Good afternoon. As you know, this country is engaged in the biggest and fastest vaccination programme in our history, and the chances are that you know someone personally who has already received a vaccine. But it would be fatal if this sense of progress were now to breed any kind of complacency because the pressures on our NHS are extraordinary. On Tuesday we saw 4,134 new admissions to hospital on a single day, the highest at any point in this pandemic. There are now more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospital across the UK and, in spite of all the efforts of our doctors and nurses and our medical staff, we are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards. And with 55,761 positive cases since yesterday and, very sadly, 1,280 deaths, this is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts. So please stay at home, please protect the NHS and save lives. And please remember that this disease can be passed on not just by standing too near someone in a supermarket queue, but also by handling something touched by an infected person. And remember also that 1 in 3 people with Covid have no symptoms, and that is why that original message of hands, face and space, washing your hands, is as important now as it has ever been. And it is precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country. So, yesterday we announced that we are banning flights from South America and Portugal. And, to protect us against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains, we will also temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday. Following conversations with the devolved administrations, we will act together so that this applies across the whole of UK This means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you have taken in the 72 hours before leaving and you must have filled in your Passenger Locator Form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off. You may also be checked when you land and face substantial fines for refusing to comply And, upon arrival, you must then quarantine for ten days – not leaving your home for any reason at all, or take another test on day 5 and wait for proof of another negative result. And we will be stepping up our enforcement – both at the border and in-country. And it is vital to take these extra measures now when day by day, hour by hour, we are making such strides in protecting the population. We have now vaccinated over 3.2 million people across the UK, doubling the numbers of last week. That’s 2.8 million in England, 225,000 in Scotland, 126,000 in Wales and 115,000 in Northern Ireland. Yesterday alone, we vaccinated around a quarter of a million people in England, and that is still far more than any other country in Europe. And with almost 45 per cent of our over 80s now vaccinated and almost 40 per cent of care home residents, we are steadily protecting those most at risk. And I pay particular tribute to the vaccination efforts going on in Cockermouth, in Cumbria, Yateley and Cheltenham, where they have vaccinated around 90 per cent of their over-80s in their communities. And I’ll also pay tribute to North Lincolnshire, to Sunderland and Morecambe Bay, where vaccination teams have protected over 80 per cent of their care home residents. And it’s thanks to that amazing constellation of the vaccination teams: doctors and nurses armed forces, local authorities, pharmacies and volunteers that we are steadily building up that immunity, that protection for the vulnerable, for the NHS and for us all. So, when the call comes, please do get a jab and, in the meantime, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. 

Boris:


Christine thank you very much, I want to thank you and I want to thank Emmanuel for organising this One Planet Summit, because I think it’s an absolutely crucial subject. After all, we’re making a lot of progress as humanity in finding the technological solutions to tackle climate change and reduce carbon. Clearly there’s a huge amount still to do but we’re starting to see a way forward since the Paris Summit five years ago which was I think a huge success, we can see that humanity can do this. But the problem is that we are destroying species and habitat at an absolutely unconscionable rate. I think we’ve lost about 500 species in the last century, of all the mammals in the world – the biomass of mammals – I think I’m right in saying that 96% of mammals on our planet are now human beings or oxen or pigs or the livestock that human beings rely on. 70% of all the birds in the world are chickens. In other words, there has been a total or near-total destruction of wildlife. Only 4% of the mammals in the world are now wild mammals, from whales to monkeys, to you name it. That in my view is a disaster. We’re seeing a parallel loss of habitat, of forests and plant species of all kinds. So that’s why the UK is pledged to protect 30% of our land surface, 30% of our marine surface, to create marine protected areas – vast protected areas – which is something by the way an objective that we share very much with France, with Canada – we’re all engaged in this same effort. And of the £11.6 billion that we’ve consecrated to climate finance initiatives, we’re putting £3 billion to protecting nature, whether it’s marine life, or timber conservation or sustainable food production. I think that as global leaders, we must go further and I’m very pleased therefore that so many countries have signed up to the UN Leaders Pledge for Nature so that we have really hard-edged targets for the preservation of species and wildlife, but also the re-wilding of our planet in the way that Sir David Attenborough has suggested. And I would like to see a world in which we give real meaning to those Aichi targets that were set so many years ago at Kyoto and I hope that our Chinese colleagues will be pushing that agenda at their Biodiversity Summit in Kunming. I know that we will be working with colleagues under the auspices of the UN to do that at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Obviously it’s right to focus on climate change, obviously it’s right to cut CO2 emissions, but we won’t achieve a real balance with our planet unless we protect nature as well. One final thought, don’t forget that the coronavirus pandemic was the product of an imbalance in man’s relationship with the natural world. Like the original plague which struck the Greeks I seem to remember in book one of the Iliad, it is a zoonotic disease. It originates from bats or pangolins, from the demented belief that if you grind up the scales of a pangolin you will somehow become more potent or whatever it is people believe, it originates from this collision between mankind and the natural world and we’ve got to stop it. And that’s why I think that this summit is so important and this focus on the natural world and on biodiversity is absolutely critical. Yes we must tackle climate change, but climate change must be seen as part of an overall agenda to protect the natural world and I think the One Planet agenda is completely right. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 7 January 2021 Good afternoon, today I’m joined by Sir Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England and Brigadier Phil Prosser, who is Commander of Military Support to the Vaccine Delivery Programme across our United Kingdom. Because I know there is now one question at the very top of your minds and that is how fast and how effectively we can get these millions of new vaccines into the arms of the most vulnerable and those who need them most. And you want to know that we in government, the NHS, the Armed Forces, local and regional government, government at every level are truly throwing everything at it round the clock if necessary. And I believe that with the country once again in lockdown and all the difficulties that means for you, for your family, for students, for education, for your businesses, and of course with the tragic number of deaths that we’re seeing and that we’ve seen today, you have a right to understand exactly how we are cracking this problem and how the national vaccine effort is progressing. And you rightly want to know how we are going to reach the target that I set out earlier this week of offering a slot for vaccination by 15th of February for everyone in those key groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation That’s over 12 million people in England, and 15 million in the UK including older care home residents and staff everyone 70 or over all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And just to remind you of the importance of these groups for fighting the disease they account for 88 per cent of all those who have sadly lost their lives. And so our tactics are first to use the immense natural capacity of the NHS and by the end of next week there will be over 1,000 GP-led sites providing vaccines 223 hospital sites seven giant vaccination centres and a first wave of 200 community pharmacies If all goes well these together should have the capacity to deliver hundreds of thousands of vaccines per day by Jan 15th and it is our plan that everyone should have a vaccination available within a radius of ten miles. And it follows from that that the limits will not be on our distributional power but on the supply of vaccines. And I have no doubt that we have enough supply to vaccinate these four groups by the Feb 15th deadline and we also have the distributional network to do it and to continue an expanding programme down that priority list. Yes, let’s be clear this is a national challenge on a scale like nothing we have seen before and it will require an unprecedented national effort. And, of course there will be difficulties appointments will be changed but as Brigadier Prosser will shortly explain the army is working hand in glove with the NHS and local councils to set up our vaccine network and using battle preparation techniques to help us keep up the pace. We will publish our full vaccine deployment plan on Monday along with daily updates on the progress we are making. We have now vaccinated 1.26 million people in England, 113,000 in Scotland, 49,000 in Wales, and 46,000 in Northern Ireland. So altogether, nearly 1.5 million people across the UK have now received their first dose and within 2-3 weeks all of them will have a very considerable degree of immunity. And it is thanks to the arrival of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which can be stored at room temperature, that we can accelerate the pace of vaccination in care homes. We are using that vaccine in care homes for the first time today and by the end of the month we hope to have offered every elderly care home resident a vaccine. Our new National Booking Service will also make it easier to book and access appointments So I urge everyone to comes forwards because it’s absolutely vital that we should have confidence in these vaccines. And I want to thank everyone involved in this extraordinary national effort all the GPs, nurses, pharmacists and all the staff behind the scenes our armed forces local councils our scientists who have not only developed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the first ever life-saving treatment of Covid in the form of dexamethasone – but I am pleased to tell you today, British scientific research has now contributed to the creation of more new lifesaving treatments that have just passed rigorous clinical trials. In particular, Tocilizumab, sorry I’ll say it again, Tocilizumab and Sarilumab, they’ll shortly be on everybody’s lips which have been found to reduce the risk of death for critically ill patients by almost a quarter and they’ve cut time spent in intensive care by as much as ten days and these lifesaving drugs will be available through the NHS with immediate effect, potentially saving thousands of lives. And finally again I want to thank you – the British public – for coming forward to be vaccinated in the numbers that you have - still greater than all the countries of Europe put together. And yes of course, we are in a race against time but I can assure you we’re doing everything we can to vaccinate as many people as possible across our whole United Kingdom. And in the meantime please stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. And now I’ll hand over to Sir Simon Stevens 

Boris:


Thank you very much Mr Speaker and can I share your gratitude to the House of Commons staff for all their efforts, their hard work to allow us to meet today in the way that we are. And before I begin my statement, I know the thoughts of the whole House are with the Hon Member for Cardiff Central who is currently in hospital with Covid, and we wish her a full and speedy recovery. With permission, I shall make a statement about the measures we are taking to defeat this new variant of Covid-19, protecting our NHS whilst it carries out the vaccinations that will finally free us from this wretched virus. And Mr Speaker, there is a fundamental difference between the regulations before the House today, and the position we have faced at any previous stage, because now we have the vaccines that are the means of our escape and we will use every available second of the lockdown to place this invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable. Already – with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – we have immunised over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million in the UK. Our NHS is following the plan drawn up by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which is aimed at saving the most lives in the fastest possible time. And given that the average age of Covid fatalities is over 80, it is significant that we have already vaccinated more than 650,000 people in this age group, meaning that within 2 to 3 weeks, almost 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will all have a significant degree of immunity. By February 15th the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff everyone over 70 all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And in working towards that target there are already almost 1,000 vaccination centres across the country including 595 GP-led sites with a further 180 opening later this week and 107 hospital sites – with another 100 later this week Next week we will also have seven vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. Pharmacies are already working with GPs to deliver the vaccine in many areas of the country and I am grateful to Brigadier Prosser who is leading the efforts of our armed forces in supporting this vaccine rollout. We have already vaccinated more people in this country than in the rest of Europe combined and we will give the House the maximum possible transparency about our acceleration of this effort publishing daily updates online from Monday so that jab by jab Hon Members can scrutinise the progress being made every single day. Yet as we take this giant leap towards finally overcoming this virus and reclaiming our lives, we have to contend with the new variant which is between 50 and 70 per cent more contagious. The old variant, which the House agreed last month, the tiers agreed by this House last month was working with the old variant. But, alas, this mutation spreading with frightening ease and speed in spite of the sterling work of the British public – has led to more cases than we have ever seen before, alas numbers that cannot be explained away by the meteoric rise in testing. When the Office for National Statistics reports that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April, it is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response. And so we now have no choice but to return to a national lockdown in England with similar measures being adopted by the Devolved Administrations – so we can control this new variant until we can take the most likely victims out of its path with vaccines. My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Health will open the debate on the full regulations shortly, but the key point I am afraid is that we are once again instructing everyone to stay at home, everyone to stay at home leaving only for limited reasons permitted by law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if people absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape injury or harm, including domestic abuse. We are advising the clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. And because we must do everything possible to stop the spread of the disease we have asked schools and colleges to close their doors to all except vulnerable children and those of critical workers. Mr Speaker, I don’t think the House will be in any doubt about our determination, my determination to keep schools open, especially primary schools – open for as long as possible. Because all the evidence shows that school is the best place for our children. And indeed all the evidence shows that schools are safe, and that the risk posed to children by Coronavirus is vanishingly small. For most children the most dangerous part of going to school, even in the midst of this global pandemic, remains I’m afraid crossing the road in order to get there. But the data showed, and our scientific advisers agreed, that our efforts to contain the spread of this new variant would not be sufficient if schools continued to act as a potential  vector for spreading the virus between households. Mr Speaker, I know the whole House will join me in paying tribute to all the teachers, all the pupils and parents who are now making the rapid move to remote learning, and we will do everything possible to support that process, building on the 560,000 laptops and tablets provided last year with over 50,000 delivered to schools on Monday and more than 100,000 being delivered in total during the first week of term. We have partnered with some of the UK’s leading mobile operators to provide free mobile data to disadvantaged families to support access to education resources. And I am very grateful to EE, Three, Tesco Mobile, Smarty, Sky Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Vodafone for supporting this offer. Oak National Academy will continue to provide video lessons and it’s very good news that the BBC is launching the biggest education programme in its history, with both primary and secondary school programmes across its platforms. We recognise it will not be possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this Summer as normal. And the Education Secretary will be making a statement shortly. Mr Speaker, I know many people will ask whether the decision on schools could have been reached sooner, and the answer is that we have been doing everything in our power to keep them open because children’s education is too vital, and their futures too precious, to be disrupted until every other avenue, every other option had been closed off and every other course of action had been taken. That is why schools were the very last thing to close, as I have long promised they would be. And when we begin to move out of lockdown I promise they will be the very first things to reopen. That moment may come after the February half-term, although we should remain extremely cautious about the timetable ahead. And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. That is why the legislation this House will vote on later today runs until 31 March. Not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis carefully brick-by-brick as it were breaking free of our confinement but without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us. The restrictions will be kept under continuous review, with a statutory requirement to review every two weeks and a legal obligation to remove them if they are no longer deemed necessary to limit the transmission of the virus. And for as long as restrictions are in place we will continue to support everyone affected by them from the continued provision of free school meals to the £4.6 billion of additional assistance for our retail, hospitality and leisure sectors announced by my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor yesterday. Mr Speaker, we are in a tough final stretch made only tougher by the new variant – but this country will come together and the miracle of scientific endeavour, much of it right here in the UK, has given us not only the sight of the finish line but a clear route to get there. After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in every arm makes a difference, As I say we are already vaccinating faster than any comparable country and that rate I hope will only increase. But if we’re going to win this race for our population we have to give our army of vaccinators the biggest head start we possibly can. And that is why to do that we must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. And I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 5 January 2021 Good afternoon, I want to update everybody about vaccines because across this entire country today there are people – everybody - making another huge sacrifice. Teachers and pupils coping with online learning Businesses who have borne the brunt of successive lockdowns and, of course, the amazing staff of our NHS and our care workers who are grappling with a new variant - this new variant - of coronavirus. And I believe that when everybody looks at the position people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice when the Office of National Statistics is telling us that more than 2 per cent of the population is now infected 
that’s over 1 million people in England –

and when today we have reported another 60,000 new cases and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40 per cent higher than at the first peak in April. I think obviously – everybody, you all - want to be sure that we in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end. And I can tell you that this afternoon 
with Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca combined – as of this afternoon

we have now vaccinated over 1.1 million people in England and over 1.3 million across the UK. And that includes more than 650,000 people over 80 
which is 23 per cent of all the over 80s in England -

And that means that nearly 1 in 4 of one of the most vulnerable groups will have in 2 to 3 weeks – all of them - a significant degree of immunity. And when you consider that the average age of Covid fatalities is in the 80s You can see the importance of what we have already achieved. And that is why I believe that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation was right to draw up a programme aimed at saving the most lives the fastest. So by February 15th, as I said last night, the NHS is committed to offering a vaccination to everyone in the top four priority groups including older care home residents and staff, everyone over 70, all frontline NHS and care staff and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And to help us with meeting this target we already have 595 GP-led sites providing vaccines, with a further 180 coming on stream later this week. We have 107 hospital sites – with a further 100 later this week So that is almost a thousand sites – vaccination sites - across the country by the end of this week And next week we will also have 7 vaccination centres opening in places such as sports stadia and exhibition centres. We know that there will still be long weeks ahead in which we must persevere with these restrictions but I want to give you – the British people – the maximum possible transparency about this vaccine roll out with more detail on Thursday and daily updates from Monday so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making. Thanks very much I am now going to hand over to Chris to do the slides. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s address to the nation: 4 January 2021 Since the pandemic began last year, the whole United Kingdom has been engaged in a great national effort to fight Covid. And there is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working and would have continued to work. But we now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible – that means you are much, much more likely to catch the virus and to pass it on. As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000. That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April. On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones. With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home. You may only leave home for limited reasons permitted in law, such as to shop for essentials, to work if you absolutely cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical assistance such as getting a Covid test, or to escape domestic abuse. The full details on what you can and can’t do will be available at gov.uk/coronavirus. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable, we are advising you to begin shielding again and you will shortly receive a letter about what this means for you. And because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries. We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. We will provide extra support to ensure that pupils entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them while schools are closed, and we’ll distribute more devices to support remote education. I completely understand the inconvenience and distress this late change will cause millions of parents and pupils up and down the country. Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner. The answer is simply that we have been doing everything in our power to keep schools open, because we know how important each day in education is to children’s life chances. And I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe for children – children are still very unlikely to be severely affected by even the new variant of Covid. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households. Today the United Kingdom’s Chief Medical Officers have advised that the country should move to alert level 5, meaning that if action is not taken NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days. Of course, there is one huge difference compared to last year. We are now rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in our history. So far, we in the UK have vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe combined. With the arrival today of the UK’s own Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine, the pace of vaccination is accelerating. I can share with you tonight the NHS’s realistic expectations for the vaccination programme in the coming weeks. By the middle of February, if things go well and with a fair wind in our sails, we expect to have offered the first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. That means vaccinating all residents in a care home for older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable. If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus. And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long. I must stress that even if we achieve this goal, there remains a time lag of two to three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity. And there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. So we should remain cautious about the timetable ahead. But if our understanding of the virus doesn’t change dramatically once again… If the rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful… If deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect… And, critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules… Then I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers. I want to say to everyone right across the United Kingdom that I know how tough this is, I know how frustrated you are, I know that you have had more than enough of government guidance about defeating this virus. But now more than ever, we must pull together. You should follow the new rules from now, and they will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Parliament will meet – largely remotely – later that day. I know that the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland share my conviction this is a pivotal moment and they’re taking similar steps. The weeks ahead will be the hardest yet but I really do believe that we are entering the last phase of the struggle. Because with every jab that goes into our arms, we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people. And, thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight and we know exactly how we will get there. But for now, I am afraid, you must once again stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you all very much. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 30 December 2020 Today I want to begin with the good news: the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine which is a fantastic achievement for British science And which will allow us to vaccinate more people, and also vaccinate them more quickly. And there is one important development that’s helping us to accelerate our vaccination programme across the whole of the UK: We’ve had new advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that the first dose can protect people against the worst effects of this virus because the benefits kick in after two or three weeks. And so from now on we will give a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible, with the second dose to follow twelve weeks later. And what that means is we can vaccinate and protect many more people in the coming weeks. I know everyone watching this will want to know when you can get your vaccine and all I want to say is we are working as hard and as fast as we can to get the supplies to you, and as soon as we have the supplies we will be getting them into people’s arms To summarise where we are We have to face the fact we’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid - One is working for us; and one working against us. On the plus side we have two valid vaccines and we are racing, as I say, to get them out. On the downside, there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country. And we have seen a 40 per cent increase in cases in England in the last week alone, almost 15 per cent more patients in hospital – more than at the peak of the first wave. And yesterday sadly we recorded almost a thousand deaths across the UK, for the first time since April. So at this critical moment with the prospect of freedom within reach We’ve got to redouble our efforts to contain the virus. That’s why the Health Secretary has announced that more areas of England will be moving into Tier 4 from tomorrow And as I say again, no-one regrets these measures more bitterly than I do. But we must take firm action now and that’s why we have to think very hard about schools. Because today of course it remains the case that keeping children in education is a national priority it remains the case that schools are safe. But we must face the reality that the sheer pace of the spread of this new variant requires us now to take even tougher action in some areas and that does affect schools Let me set out for you what this means. In most of England, primary schools will still reassemble next week, as planned for the new term. But, in the areas we have just published today on gov.uk, I am afraid the start of the new term will be delayed until at least January 18, when the latest data on those infection rates will be reviewed. That is because the rate of transmission in these areas is so high, and there’s just such pressure on the local NHS, that extra action is required to control the spread of the virus. The children of key workers, or those who are considered to be vulnerable, will still go back to primary schools from next week – wherever they live in England. They are not affected by today’s announcement. In secondary schools, all vulnerable children and the children of critical workers will go back next week across England, as originally planned. But we will ask exam year pupils in secondary schools to learn remotely during the first week of term and return to the classroom from 11 January. The remaining secondary school pupils, i.e. non exam groups will go back a week later, that is from 18 January – but I want to stress that depending on the spread of the disease it may be necessary to take further action in their cases as well, in as I say the worst affected areas. To minimise disruption in schools and to fight the disease we are massively expanding our testing operation ensuring that every secondary school pupil is tested as they return, and regularly thereafter. Again I want to thank the teachers, pupils and parents who have worked so hard to keep schools safe and keep them open. We are also asking universities to reduce the number of students who return to campus in January, prioritising medical courses and others requiring face to face teaching. And in all cases, students should be offered two rapid tests when they return. All of these measures are in the end designed to save lives and to protect the NHS. And for that very reason, I must ask you to follow the rules where you live tomorrow night and see in the New Year safely at home. That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind. We are still in the tunnel of this pandemic the light however is not merely visible: thanks to an extraordinary feat of British engineering if you like the tunnel has been shortened and we are moving faster through it, and that gives me great confidence about the future in the Spring So for now let’s double our efforts, let’s follow the rules, protect our NHS and together make 2021 the year we leave this tunnel behind us. 

Boris:


Thank you Mr Speaker, can I begin by thanking you and the House authorities and all your staff and their hard work in allowing us to meet today, and can I also welcome the outstanding news that AstraZeneca is now rolling out a new UK made vaccine approved by the MHRA that offers the hope to millions in this country and around the world, Mr Speaker I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time, and having taken back control of our money, our borders, our laws and our waters by leaving the European Union on Jan 31st, we now seize the moment to forge a fantastic new relationship with our European neighbours, based on free trade and friendly co-operation. And at the heart of this Bill is one of the biggest free trade agreements in the world, a comprehensive Canada-style deal, worth over £660 billion, which, if anything, should allow our companies to do even more business with our European friends, safeguarding millions of jobs and livelihoods in our UK and across the continent. In less than 48 hours, we will leave the EU single market and the customs union, as we promised and yet British exporters will not face a sudden thicket of trade barriers, but rather, for the first time in the history of EU agreements, zero tariffs and zero quotas. And just as we have avoided trade barriers, so we have also ensured the UK’s full control of our laws and our regulations and there is a vital symmetry between those two achievements, because the central purpose of this Bill is to accomplish something that the British people always knew in their hearts could be done, but which we were continually told was impossible, we were told we could not have our cake and eat it, do you remember how often we were told that Mr Speaker, namely that we could trade and cooperate with our European neighbours on the closest terms of friendship and goodwill, whilst retaining sovereign control of our laws and our national destiny. And that unifying thread runs through every clause of this Bill, it embodies our vision – shared with our European neighbours – of a new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values,  while respecting one another’s freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently and we have much to gain from the healthy stimulus of competition. And this Bill demonstrates therefore how Britain can be at once European and sovereign. And I think you’ll agree Mr Speaker our negotiators accomplished their feat with astonishing speed. It took nearly 8 years for the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to produce a deal, and five years for the EU to reach a trade agreement with Canada, six for Japan. We have done this in less than a year, in the teeth of a pandemic, and we have pressed ahead with this task, resisting all the calls for delay, Mr Speaker precisely because creating certainty about our future provides the best chance of beating Covid and bouncing back even more strongly next year. And that was our objective. So I hope the House will join me in commending my Noble Friend Lord Frost and every member of his team for their skill, their mastery and their perseverance in translating our vision into a practical agreement. And let me also pay tribute to President Ursula von der Leyen, Michel Barnier and all our European friends for their pragmatism and foresight and for their understanding that it is profoundly in the interests of the EU to live alongside a prosperous, contented and sovereign United Kingdom. The House understands the significance of the fact that the basis of this agreement is not EU law but international law, so there is no direct effect, the EU law will no longer have any special status in the UK and there is no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice. We will be able to design our own standards and regulations, And Mr Speaker the laws that this House of Commons passes will be interpreted – and I know this is of keen interest to honourable and right honourable members - solely by British judges sitting in British courts. We will have opportunity to devise new ways to spur and encourage the flourishing sectors in which this country leads the world, from green energy and life sciences to synthetic biology. We will be free Mr Speaker of EU state aid rules, We’ll be able to decide where and how we level up across our country with new jobs and new hope, including with freeports and new green industrial zones of a kind I’m sure he’d approve of. And if, in using our new freedoms, either Britain or the EU believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut, then subject to independent third party arbitration - and provided the measures are proportionate - either of us can decide, as sovereign equals, to protect our consumers. But this treaty explicitly envisages that any such action should be infrequent and it banishes the old concepts of uniformity and harmonisation in favour of the right to make our own regulatory choices and deal with the consequences. And Mr Speaker, every modern free trade agreement includes reciprocal commitments designed to prevent distortions of trade and the true significance of the agreement embodied in this Bill is that there is no role for the European Court of Justice, no ratchet clause on labour or environmental standards and no dynamic alignment with the EU State Aid regime - or indeed any other aspect of EU law. In every respect, we have recovered our freedom of action. We will be free of the strictures of the Common Agricultural Policy, We’ll be able to conserve our landscapes and support our farmers exactly as we choose. And on Friday – for the first time 50 years – on Friday the UK will once again be recognised as an independent coastal state, regaining control of our waters, righting the wrong that was done by the Common Fisheries Policy throughout our EU Membership. And of course, I’ve always recognised Mr Speaker that this was going to be a difficult period for our European friends and partners, because they’ve been fishing in these waters for decades if not centuries and at first - as the House will know - they sought an adjustment period of 14 years, but our negotiators whittled that down to five and a half years, during which the UK’s share - in that five and a half years – the UK’s share of our fish in our waters will rise from over half today to around two thirds. And of course we would like to have done this more quickly, but it’s also true that once the adjustment period comes to an end, there will be no limit Mr speaker – other than the limits placed by the needs of science and conservation – on our ability to make use of our marine wealth, and 15 per cent of the EU’s historic catch from our waters will be returned to this country next year alone. And as I say to prepare our fishing communities for that moment, we will invest £100 million in a programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry, Restoring Mr Speaker a great British industry to the eminence that it deserves, levelling up communities across the UK – particularly and including in Scotland Where their interests in my view have been neglected for too long. So I do find it extraordinary that on the eve of this great opportunity the declared position of the Scottish National nationalist Party is to hand control – with a small n – is to hand control of the very waters we have just reclaimed straight back to the EU. That is their policy Mr Speaker. And they plan to ensnare Scotland’s fishing fleet in the dragnets of the Common Fisheries Policy all over again. And, in the meantime, Mr Speaker – guess what they are going to do today - they are going to vote today for a “No Deal Brexit”, proving once and for all, that the interests of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are best served by a One Nation party serving One United Kingdom. Mr Speaker, this deal was negotiated by a big team, and he should know this, from every part of our United Kingdom, and it serves the whole of the UK, not least by protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom single internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it. Our points-based immigration system will end free movement and give us full control over who enters our country and by the way on that point I want to thank very much my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for all he did to protect the interest of Northern Ireland. And at the same time the deal provides certainty for airlines and hauliers – who have suffered grievously during this pandemic – It guarantees the freedom of British citizens to travel to and from the EU, and retain access to healthcare. It provides certainty for our police, for our border forces, for our security agencies, who work alongside our European friends to keep our people safe. They are going to vote against this Mr Speaker. It provides certainty for our partnerships on scientific research, because we want our country to be a science superpower, but also a collaborative science superpower. And it provides certainty for business Mr Speaker. from financial services to our world leading manufactures, including our car industry, safeguarding highly skilled jobs and investment across our country. As for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker, I am delighted that he has found yet another position on Brexit, and having plunged down every blind alley and exhausted every possible alternative, he has come to the right conclusion, namely to vote for this agreement which this Government has secured. But alas the good news about the Labour party stops there Because I’m told the Right Honourable Gentleman intends to ask the British people for a mandate to rewrite the deal in 2024. That’s what he wants to do. I think frankly Mr Speaker we got Brexit done, let’s keep Brexit done, and let’s keep Brexit done, and let’s press ahead with this Government’s mission to unite and level up across our whole country and grasp the opportunities before us. Because I have always said that Brexit is not an end but a beginning, and the responsibility now rests with all of us to make the best use of the powers that we have regained, and the tools that we have taken back into our hands. And we’re going to begin by fulfilling our manifesto promise to maintain the highest standards of labour and environmental regulation, because no caricature could be more inaccurate than the idea of some bargain basement, Dickensian Britain, as if enlightened EU regulation has in the past been our only salvation from Dickensian squalor. Our national standards have always been among the very best in the world and this House can be trusted to use its new freedom to keep them that way, without any outside invigilation. We are going to open Mr Speaker a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world, adding to the agreements with 63 countries we have already achieved, and reasserting Global Britain as a liberal, outward-looking force for good. Detaching ourselves from the EU is only a prelude to the greater task of establishing our new role, and this country is contributing more than any other to vaccinate people across the world against Covid and leading the way in preventing future pandemics and we will continue to campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world and I thank my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary for what he’s doing on that, and we will continue to lead the drive towards global net zero, as we host COP26 in Glasgow next year. And I hope and believe – and I think actually the tone this morning has given me encouragement in this belief Mr Speaker – the mood in the House this morning which seems to me on the whole to be positive. I hope in spite of the as usual, thin, synthetic, confected indignation that we hear from some of the benches opposite – I hope and believe that this agreement will also serve to end some of the rancour and recrimination that we’ve had in recent years, allow us to come to together as a country, to leave old arguments, old desiccated super masticated arguments behind, move on and build a new and great future for our country. Because those of us who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU never sought a rupture with our closest neighbours. We never wanted to sever ourselves from fellow democracies beneath whose soil lie British war graves in tranquil cemeteries, often tended by local schoolchildren, testament to our shared struggle for freedom and everything we cherish in common. What we wanted was not a rupture but a resolution, a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe, which has bedevilled our post-War history. First, we stood aloof, then we became a half-hearted, sometimes obstructive member of the EU. Now, with this Bill, we are going to become a friendly neighbour   – the best friend and ally the EU could have –  working hand-in-glove whenever our values and interests coincide while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own laws,  made by their own elected Parliament. That is the historic resolution delivered by this Bill and Mr Speaker I commend it to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on EU negotiations: 24 December 2020 It is four and a half years since the British people voted to take back control of their money, their borders, their laws, and their waters and to leave the European Union. And earlier this year we fulfilled that promise and we left on Jan 31 with that oven-ready deal. Since that time we have been getting on with our agenda. Enacting the points based immigration system that you voted for and that will come into force on Jan 1. And doing free trade deals with 58 countries around the world. And preparing the new relationship with the EU. And there have been plenty of people who have told us that the challenges of the Covid pandemic have made this work impossible. And that we should extend the transition period. And incur yet more delay. And I rejected that approach precisely because beating Covid is our number one national priority and I wanted to end any extra uncertainty and to give this country the best possible chance of bouncing back strongly next year. And so I am very pleased that this afternoon that we have completed the biggest trade deal yet, worth £660 billion. A comprehensive Canada style free trade deal between the UK and the EU, a deal that will protect jobs across this country. A deal that will allow UK goods and components to be sold without tariffs and without quotas in the EU market. A deal which will if anything should allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends. And yet which achieves something that the people of this country instinctively knew was doable. But which they were told was impossible. We have taken back control of laws and our destiny. We have taken back control of every jot and tittle of our regulation. In a way that is complete and unfettered. From Jan 1 we are outside the customs union, and outside the single market. British laws will be made solely by the British Parliament. Interpreted by UK judges sitting in UK courts. And the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will come to an end. We will be able to set our own standards, to innovate in the way that we want, to originate new frameworks for the sectors in which this country leads the world, from biosciences to financial services, artificial intelligence and beyond. We will be able to decide how and where we are going to stimulate new jobs and new hope. With freeports and new green industrial zones. We will be able to cherish our landscape and our environment in the way we choose. Backing our farmers and backing British food and agricultural production. And for the first time since 1973 we will be an independent coastal state with full control of our waters with the UK’s share of fish in our waters rising substantially from roughly half today to closer to 2/3 in five and a half years’ time after which there is no theoretical limit beyond those placed by science or conservation on the quantity of our own fish that we can fish in our waters. And to get ready for that moment those fishing communities we will be helped with a big £100m programme to modernise their fleets and the fish processing industry. And I want to stress that although of course the arguments with our European friends and partners were sometimes fierce this is, I believe a good deal for the whole of Europe and for our friends and partners as well. Because it will not be a bad thing for the EU to have a prosperous and dynamic and contented UK on your doorstep. And it will be a good thing – it will drive jobs and prosperity across the whole continent. And I don’t think it will be a bad thing if we in the UK do things differently, or a take a different approach to legislation. Because in so many ways our basic goals are the same. And in the context of this giant free trade zone that we’re jointly creating the stimulus of regulatory competition will I think benefit us both. And if one side believes it is somehow being unfairly undercut by the other, then subject to independent third party arbitration and provided the measures are proportionate, we can either of us decide – as sovereign equals - to protect our consumers. But this treaty explicitly envisages that such action should only happen infrequently and the concepts of uniformity and harmonisation are banished in favour of mutual respect and mutual recognition and free trade. And for squaring that circle, for finding the philosopher’s stone that’s enabled us to do this I want to thank President von der Leyen of the European Commission and our brilliant negotiators led by Lord Frost and Michel Barnier, on the EU side Stephanie Rousseau as well as Oliver Lewis, Tim Barrow, Lindsay Appleby and many others. Their work will be available for scrutiny, followed by a parliamentary vote I hope on Dec 30. This agreement, this deal above all means certainty. It means certainty for the aviation industry and the hauliers who have suffered so much in the Covid pandemic. It means certainty for the police and the border forces and the security services and all those that we rely on across Europe to keep us safe. It means certainty for our scientists who will be able to continue to work together on great collective projects. Because although we want the UK to be a science superpower, we also want to be a collaborative science superpower. And above all it means certainty for business from financial services to our world-leading manufacturers – our car industry – certainty for those working in high skilled jobs in firms and factories across the whole country. Because there will be no palisade of tariffs on Jan 1. And there will be no non-tariff barriers to trade. And instead there will be a giant free trade zone of which we will at once be a member. And at the same time be able to do our own free trade deals as one UK, whole and entire, England, NI, Scotland and Wales together. And I should stress this deal was done by a huge negotiating team from every part of the UK, and it will benefit every part of our United Kingdom, helping to unite and level up across the country. And so I say again directly to our EU friends and partners, I think this deal means a new stability and a new certainty in what has sometimes been a fractious and difficult relationship. We will be your friend, your ally, your supporter and indeed – never let it be forgotten – your number one market. Because although we have left the EU this country will remain culturally, emotionally, historically, strategically and geologically attached to Europe, not least through the four million EU nationals who have requested to settle in the UK over the last four years and who make an enormous contribution to our country and to our lives. And I say to all of you at home. At the end of this toughest of years. That our focus in the weeks ahead is of course on defeating the pandemic. And on beating coronavirus and rebuilding our economy. And delivering jobs across the country. And I am utterly confident that we can and will do it. By today we have vaccinated almost 800,000 people and we have also today resolved a question that has bedevilled our politics for decades. And it is up to us all together. As a newly and truly independent nation. To realise the immensity of this moment and to make the most of it. Happy Christmas to you all. That’s the good news from Brussels – now for the sprouts. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 21 December 2020 Good afternoon, I want to update everyone on one thing and that’s what’s happening at our borders and especially at Dover. Last night at 11pm the French Government imposed restrictions on UK freight crossing to France when accompanied by a driver. And so today I chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency, COBR committee in order to co-ordinate a UK-wide response. And it is vital first to stress that these delays – which are only occurring at Dover – only affect human-handled freight, and that is only 20 per cent of the total arriving from or departing to the European continent, which means the vast majority of food, medicines and other supplies are coming and going as normal. You may also be aware – in fact I’d be amazed if you weren’t – that the government has been preparing for a long time for this exactly kind of event. So working with the Kent Resilience Forum, Kent County Council and Highways England, we’ve activated our long-prepared plans, with the result that we have already been able to reduce the number of lorries waiting on the M20 from 500 to 170. The site at Manston Airfield is ready to cope with any overflow. And, of course, we are working with our friends across the Channel to unblock the flow of trade as fast as possible. The Government at all levels is communicating with our friends in Paris I have just spoken to President Macron - we had a very good call - we both understand each other’s positions and want to resolve these problems as fast as possible. I know that Grant is also speaking to his counterpart and we are working to a solution, as I say, as fast as we can to allow freight traffic to resume between the UK and France, and ensure that lorries can travel in both directions in a Covid-secure way. I want to stress that we in the UK fully understand the anxieties of our friends about Covid, their anxieties about the new variant, but it is also true that we believe the risks of transmission by a solitary driver sitting alone in the cab are really very low. And so we hope to make progress as fast as we possibly can. I want to repeat that these delays only apply to a very small percentage of food entering the UK, and as British supermarkets have said, their supply chains are strong and robust, so everyone can continue to shop normally. And to our international friends and partners I want to say very frankly: We understand your concerns, And I hope that everybody can see that as soon as we were briefed as a government of the fast transmissibility of this new strain at about 3.15pm on Friday afternoon, We lodged all the necessary information with the World Health Organisation And we took prompt and decisive action the very next day to curb the spread of the variant within the UK. And we want to work with our colleagues, with our friends around the world, as we have from the beginning to develop new treatments and new vaccines. And today I can announce that half a million people in the UK have now received their first dose. As we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, this virus alas can move all too swiftly from one nation to another, But it is steadily being defeated by an international response An international response that is bringing the hope of vaccines to the entire world, And in that the UK will continue to play our full part. I’ll now handover to our Secretary of State, Grant. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I am sorry to report that the situation has deteriorated since I last spoke to you three days ago. Yesterday afternoon, I was briefed on the latest data showing the virus spreading more rapidly in London, the South East and the East of England than would be expected given the tough restrictions which are already in place. I also received an explanation for why the virus is spreading more rapidly in these areas. It appears this spread is now being driven by the new variant of the virus, which we first learned about earlier this week. Our advisory group on New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats – NERVTAG – has spent the last few days analysing the new variant. There is no evidence the variant causes more severe illness or higher mortality, but it does appear to be passed on significantly more easily. NERVTAG’s early analysis suggests the new variant could increase R by 0.4 or greater. Although there is considerable uncertainty, it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant. This is early data. It is subject to review. It is the best we have at the moment, and we have to act on information as we have it because this is now spreading very fast. The U.K. has by far the best genomic sequencing ability in the world, which means we are better able to identify new strains like this than any other country. The Chief Medical Officer last night submitted our findings so far to the World Health Organisation and we will continue to be totally transparent with our global partners. There is still much we don’t know. While we are fairly certain the variant is transmitted more quickly, there is no evidence to suggest that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness. Equally there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine will be any less effective against the new variant. Our experts will continue their work to improve our understanding of the variant. So we are learning more about this variant as we go. But we know enough already to be sure that we must act now. I met ministers on the Covid Operations Committee last night and again first thing this morning, and Cabinet met at lunchtime to agree the following actions. First, we will introduce new restrictions in the most affected areas – specifically those parts of London, the South East and the East of England which are currently in tier 3. These areas will enter a new tier 4, which will be broadly equivalent to the national restrictions which were in place in England in November. That means: Residents in those areas must stay at home, apart from limited exemptions set out in law.
Non-essential retail, indoor gyms and leisure facilities, and personal care services must close.
People must work from home if they can, but may travel to work if this is not possible, for example in the construction and manufacturing sectors.
People should not enter or leave tier 4 areas, and tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home.
Individuals can only meet one person from another household in an outdoor public space. Unlike the November national restrictions, communal worship can continue to take place in tier 4 areas. These measures will take effect from tomorrow morning. All tiers will continue to be regularly reviewed in line with the approach previously set out, with the next formal review point taking place on 30 December. Second, we are issuing new advice on travel. Although the new variant is concentrated in tier 4 areas, it is nonetheless present at lower levels around the country. We are asking everyone, in all tiers, to stay local. People should carefully consider whether they need to travel abroad and follow the rules in their tier. Those in tier 4 areas will not be permitted to travel abroad apart from limited exceptions, such as for work purposes. Third, we must, I am afraid, look again at Christmas. As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned. In England, those living in tier 4 areas should not mix with anyone outside their own household at Christmas, though support bubbles will remain in place for those at particular risk of loneliness or isolation. Across the rest of the country, the Christmas rules allowing up to three households to meet will now be limited to Christmas Day only, rather than the five days as previously set out. As before, there will be no relaxation on 31 December, so people must not break the rules at New Year. I know how much emotion people invest in this time of year, and how important it is for grandparents to see their grandchildren, and for families to be together. So I know how disappointing this will be, but we have said throughout this pandemic that we must and we will be guided by the science. When the science changes, we must change our response. When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defence. As your Prime Minister, I sincerely believe there is no alternative open to me. Without action, the evidence suggests infections would soar, hospitals would become overwhelmed and many thousands more would lose their lives. I want to stress we are not alone in this fight – many of our European friends and neighbours are being forced to take similar action. We are working closely with the devolved administrations to protect people in every part of the UK. Of course there is now hope – real hope – that we will soon be rid of this virus. That prospect is growing with every day that passes and every vaccine dose administered. The UK was the first country in the western world to start using a clinically approve vaccine. So please, if the NHS contacts you then get your vaccine – and join the 350,000 people across the UK who have already had their first dose. Yes, Christmas this year will be very different, but we must be realistic. We are sacrificing our chance to see loved ones this Christmas, so we have a better chance of protecting their lives so we can see them at future Christmases. As sure as night follows day, we will beat back this virus. We will defeat it. And we will reclaim our lives. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 16 December 2020 It is just a week since the United Kingdom began the biggest vaccination programme in our history. And the public is coming forward at an extraordinary pace to get a jab, to protect themselves, beginning with the elderly and the most vulnerable. With 138,000 recipients of the first dose – and more joining them every minute - there is no doubt we are winning and we will win our long struggle against this virus which makes it all the more important that we hold our nerve this winter. Because we are now in a race to protect us all while doing everything we can to keep the virus under control. And thanks to the colossal collective effort in November we did bring the R below 1 we did get the infection rate down. But I must be frank with you we are already seeing worrying rises in some parts of the country: Kent is still seeing rising infections the number of cases in London is at 270 per 100,000 people. And that’s why we acted quickly by moving London into Tier 3 from today. And tomorrow the Health Secretary will announce the outcome of the latest tiering review. And so like every other European country facing similar challenges we have come to this moment, a great global festival a turning point, a time of year that is of immense emotional and spiritual importance. But also a moment for us to exercise extreme caution when we must remember that one of the most striking features of this virus is that it spreads invisibly from people who don’t even have symptoms which is in fact around 1 in 3 of everyone infected. And that’s why from the beginning this virus has been so hard to fight and that’s why it’s so important to follow the rules and why this Christmas it’s vital that everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility. And having looked at the latest data – with our colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, we have decided that the overall situation is alas worse and more challenging than we had hoped when we first set the rules. So while it would not be right to criminalise people who have made plans and simply want to spend time with their loved ones, we are all collectively across the UK, governments at every level, asking you to think hard and in detail about the days ahead and whether you can do more to protect yourself and others. We are keeping the laws the same – but we all want to send the same message: a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas, and a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas. When we say three households can meet on five days, I want to stress these are maximums, not targets to aim for. And of course it is always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet. And that means that if you are visiting others over Christmas, we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday - to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possible because this virus spreads from human contact. If possible don’t travel from a high prevalence to a low prevalence area and avoid staying away from home overnight if you can. Remember, the vaccine is on the way and our aim is to inoculate everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable or elderly in the early months of next year. So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others. And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated. And whatever your plans for Christmas, please think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day Sales And no one should be gathering in large groups to see in the New Year – remember the rules in your local area will apply. In most places across the UK, I’m afraid that means you cannot mix with other households indoors. All the information about how best to protect yourself and your loved ones is being made available on gov.uk. So have yourselves a merry little Christmas And I’m afraid this year I do mean little But with the vaccine, and all the other measures that we are taking, We do know things will be better in this country by Easter And I’m sure that next year Christmas will be as normal for every family in the country. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 2 December It is almost a year since humanity has been tormented by COVID Across the world, economic output has plummeted and a million and a half people have died And all the time we have waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy And give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill – and now the scientists have done it And they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine from an idea that was pioneered in this country by Edward Jenner in 1796 And today we can announce that the government has accepted the recommendation from the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for distribution across the United Kingdom. after months of clinical trials, involving thousands of people to ensure that the vaccine meets the strictest, internationally recognised, standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. Thanks to the fantastic work of Kate Bingham and the Vaccines Task Force, we purchased more than 350 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates, and the UK was the first country in the world to pre-order supplies of this Pfizer vaccine securing 40 million doses. Through our Winter Plan, the NHS has been preparing for the biggest programme of mass vaccination in the history of the UK. And that is going to begin next week, and in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation the first phase will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable, But there are immense logistical challenges: the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart. So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected, Long and cold months So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism Or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over Its not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan, a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus, protect the NHS and the vulnerable, keep education and the economy going and use treatments, testing and vaccines to enable us to return to much closer to normal by spring. Today in England we have ended national restrictions, opening up significant parts of the economy in doing so; but also replacing them with tough tiers to keep this virus down. And I know that those tiers will mean continued hardship for many, and it is going to continue to be tough for some sectors but until the vaccine is deployed, our plan does rely on all of us continuing to make sacrifices to protect those we love. So please, please continue to follow the rules where you live, remember hands, face, space – and if you live in a tier 3 area where community testing will be made available, please take part in that community testing. Together, these steps are for now the surest way to protect yourselves and those you love and by reducing the transmission of the virus, help de-escalate your area to a lower level of restrictions, as vaccines and testing, as I say, take an ever larger share of the burden. And as we do all this, we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed: and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations now be approved. And I want to begin by telling the House that I was hugely encouraged by a visit I paid only yesterday to a vaccine plant in North Wales where I saw for myself the vials of one of seven vaccines backed by the UK Government that could turn the tide of our struggle against Covid, not just in this country but around the world. It is the protection of those vaccines that could get our economies moving again, and allow us to reclaim our lives. And that one plant in Wrexham could produce 300 million doses a year and yesterday was the momentous day when it began to manufacture the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And it was a very moving moment Mr Speaker when I talked to one of the brilliant young scientists there, And she described the extraordinary moment for her in her life, to be part of an enterprise that was she thought truly going to offer humanity a route out of this suffering. But Mr Speaker, we have to be realistic, And we have to accept that this vaccine is not here yet, no vaccine is here yet and while all the signs are promising and almost every scientist I’ve talked to agrees that the breakthrough will surely come we do not yet have one that has gained regulatory approval. We can’t be completely sure when the moment will arrive and until then we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter. The national measures which are now shortly ending in England have eased the burden on the NHS and begun to reverse the advance of the virus. Today, the R is back below 1 and the ONS survey is showing that signs of the infection rate are levelling off and Imperial College London has found that the number of people with Covid has fallen by a third in England since 2nd November. But while the virus has been contained, it has not been eradicated. The latest ONS figures suggest that out of every 85 people in England, one has Coronavirus; far more than in the Summer between 24th November and yesterday, 3,222 people across the UK lost their lives; and despite the immense progress of the last four weeks, our NHS remains under pressure, with hospitals in three regions – the South West, the North East and Yorkshire - all treating more Covid patients now than at the peak of the first wave. So we can’t simply allow the current restrictions to expire for the reason he gives with no replacement whatever. With the spread of the epidemic varying across the country, there remains a compelling case for regional tiers in England and indeed Mr Speaker a compelling necessity for regional tiers. But I hope the House is clear what I am not asking for today. This is not another lockdown, nor is this the renewal of the existing measures in England. The tiers that I am proposing would mean that from tomorrow everyone in England – including those in tier 3 – will be free to leave their homes for any reason. And when they do, they will find the shops open for Christmas, the hairdressers open, the nail bars open, gyms and leisure centres, swimming pools open, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples will be open for communal worship. Organised outdoor sport will resume, and in every tier you will be able to meet others in parks and in public gardens subject to the Rule of Six. And every one of those things has been by necessity restricted until today. Every one of them would be allowed again tomorrow. Of course I accept that this is not a return to normality. I wish it were so. But it is a bit closer to normality than the present restrictions. And what we cannot do is lift all of the restrictions at once, or move too quickly, in such a way that the virus would begin to spread rapidly again. That would be the surest way of endangering our NHS and forcing us into a new year lockdown, with all the costs that that would impose. We all accept that the burden on the hospitality sector has been very great. We feel this deeply, because our pubs, our hotels, restaurants they are in many ways the heart of the communities And part of the fabric of our identity as a country And everybody can see that the hospitality industry has borne a disproportionate share of the burden in this crisis. There’s no question about it. And that is obviously because we want to keep schools open Mr Speaker and we have to take such measures as we can. I would just remind the House however, that we are not alone in this. In France bars, restaurants and gyms will not reopen until 20th January at the earliest. In Germany, the hospitality sector will remain closed in its entirety over Christmas. But we will do everything in our power to support our hospitality sector throughout this crisis. We have already extended the furlough scheme for all businesses until the end of March, We’ve provided monthly grants of up to £3,000 for premises forced to close, and £2,100 for those that remain open but have suffered because of reduced demand. We have allocated £1.1 billion for local authorities to support businesses at particular risk. And today Mr Speaker we are going further with a one-off payment of £1,000 in December to wet pubs – that is Mr Speaker pubs that do not serve food as the House knows recognising how hard they have been hit by this virus in what is typically their busiest month. We will also work with the hospitality sector in supporting their bounce back next year. Mr Speaker I want to stress, that the situation is profoundly different now because there is an end in sight. And I am not this afternoon seeking open-ended measures. On the contrary, these regulations come with a sunset clause at the end of February, sorry at the end of the 2 February I should say Mr Speaker. At that point we will have sufficient data to assess our position after Christmas, and though I believe these types of restrictions will be needed until the Spring, they can only be extended beyond 2 February if this House votes for them Mr Speaker. These are points that have been made with great power as I say by Hon Members on all sides of the House. We will review the allocation of tiers every fourteen days, starting on 16th December. I just want to make an important point to my Rt Hon friend and to all members who are rightly concerned about the position of their constituencies, our constituencies, in these tiers. Hon Members have it in their powers, in our power to help move our areas down the tiers, by throwing their full weight Mr Speaker, our full weight as leaders in our communities behind community testing, and seizing the opportunity, seizing the opportunity to encourage as many people as possible to take part. Of the kind we’ve seen in Liverpool Mr Speaker where since the 6th November over 284,000 tests have been conducted, and together with the effect of national restrictions, the number of cases fell by more than two thirds. This is the model that I would recommend. We are now proposing that from tomorrow Liverpool City Region and Warrington should be in tier 2, where as previously obviously they were in tier 3. And we want other regions and other towns, cities, communities to follow this path, And that is why – with the help of our fantastic armed forces – we will be offering community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible. Mr Speaker let me just say, I find it extraordinary that the Official Opposition –represented by the gentleman opposite - Currently have no view on the way ahead and are not proposing to vote tonight. I do think it is extraordinary that in spite of the barrage of criticism that we have no credible plan from the party opposite. Indeed, we have no view on the way ahead. It’s a quite extraordinary thing Mr Speaker that tonight to the best of my knowledge The RHG Opposite who has always said he will ‘act in the national interest’ has told his party to sit on its hands and to abstain in the vote tonight Mr Speaker. And I think the government has made its decision, we’ve taken some tough decisions Mr Speaker and the Labour opposition has decided tonight heroically to abstain Mr Speaker And I think when the history of this pandemic comes to be written, I think the people of this country will observe that instead of having politicians of all parties coming together in the national interest they had one party taking the decisions and another party heroically deciding to abstain Mr Speaker, in the story of 2020, I think there are two great feats in which we can take a great deal of comfort. First, our country has come together in an extraordinary effort that has so far succeeded in protecting our NHS and in saving many lives. And while our scientists have been zeroing in on the weaknesses of Covid, telescoping ten years of work into ten months, and now their endeavours are about to deliver the means as I say to rout the virus. That is clear. The Government is backing not one potential vaccine, but seven. We have ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that is now seeking regulatory approval. We have ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which has almost 95 per cent effectiveness in trials. And Mr Speaker, we have ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which if approved by the regulator – could start being administered before Christmas. In total, Mr Speaker our Vaccines Task Force has secured more than 350 million doses, more than enough for everyone in the UK, the Crown Dependencies and our Overseas Territories. All we need to do now Mr Speaker is to hold our nerve until these vaccines are indeed in our grasp, and indeed being injected into our arms. So I say to the House again let us follow the guidance, let us roll out mass testing, let’s work to deliver mass testing to the people of our country, let’s work together to control the virus and it is in that spirit that I commend these regulations Mr Speaker I commend these regulations to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 26 November 2020 We now have reason to hope that by Spring, community testing and vaccines will combine to end this era of restrictions. But to get there we must first navigate a hard winter when the burden on our NHS is heaviest and the cold weather favours the virus. The data already suggests national measures in England have slowed - and in some places reversed - the growth of new cases. As more data comes in, we hope and expect to see those trends continue. Together we have prevented our NHS from being overwhelmed, but those dangers have not gone away. If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean. The tough measures in our Winter Plan are the best way to avoid this outcome. All our friends around the world are grappling with the same question of how to keep people safe without retreating into a winter of hibernation. In Italy there is a nightly curfew, in Germany, hospitality will remain closed until 20th December, and in France, until 20 January. Across the whole of the UK, measures remain in place to control the virus. Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions. Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators: cases across all ages, especially the over 60s, the rate by which cases are rising or falling the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid and the pressure on the NHS. We are publishing data packs setting out the reasons behind decisions in each area. To find out how this affects you, log on to gov.uk where all the information is available. I’m sorry to confirm that, from Wednesday, most of England will be in the top two tiers with the toughest measures. I know this will bring a great deal of heartache and frustration, especially for our vital hospitality sector, our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, in so many ways the soul of our communities - which continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden. I really wish it were otherwise, but if we are to keep schools open – as we must - then our options in bearing down on the disease are necessarily limited. What we will do is continue taking every possible step to protect jobs and livelihoods across the UK. These tougher tiers strike a balance – they are sufficient to continue driving the virus downwards but it’s important to recognise they are less intrusive than the current national measures. In all tiers, shops, gyms and the leisure sector, hairdressers, other forms of personal care, places of worship will reopen. You will no longer be instructed to stay at home, though you should continue to work from home if you can. The rule of 6 will once again apply in public outdoor spaces and organised outdoor sport can begin again. But there is no doubt that the restrictions in all tiers are tough – and I am sorry about that. While the data is beginning to improve, the virus is still prevalent, and the faster we drive it down the faster we can lift restrictions. And that is exactly what these new tiers are designed to achieve. While the previous tiers slowed the spread of the virus, they were never quite enough to cut the R below 1 and keep it there, so areas did not escape whatever level they were placed in. Our new approach is designed to reduce R below 1, opening a path for areas to move down the scale, as soon as the situation improves. And crucially, we now have the means to accelerate that moment of escape with rapid community testing, allowing anyone carrying the disease - including those without symptoms – to isolate thereby reducing the R. And the truth is that at least one in three people with Covid have no symptoms at all and may be spreading the disease without even knowing that they’ve got it. The only way to identify them and protect everyone is through mass testing. Liverpool shows what can be achieved. In Liverpool, in the space of two and a half weeks, over 240,000 tests have been conducted and together with the effect of national restrictions, this has helped to reduce the number of cases in Liverpool City Region by more than two thirds. So having previously been in tier 3, Liverpool City Region and Warrington will now be in tier 2. This is a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate so we will work with local government, public health leaders and our fantastic Armed Forces, to offer community testing to tier 3 areas as quickly as possible, opening the way for them to follow Liverpool’s example. Testing on this scale is untried, but in due course, if it works, where people test negative, it may also be possible for families and communities to be released from certain restrictions even if their home area stays in tier 3. The allocation of tiers will be reviewed every fourteen days, starting on 16 December. So your tier is not your destiny. Every area has the means of escape. And I have no doubt that together we can get through this Winter, suppress the virus until vaccines come to our aid, and then reclaim our lives and all the things that we love. 

Boris:


It seems that almost every week we learn of some new scientific breakthrough to help us beat Covid last week it was good news about the vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech and then Moderna This morning we heard the fantastic news that the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine has been highly effective in clinical trials there are more tests to be done, but the signs are that this vaccine 
financed partly by British taxpayers, working in partnership with a great British company –

This vaccine could be both affordable and easy to use and highly effective We have ordered 100m doses and thanks to the work of the Vaccines Task Force we have secured more than 350m doses of potential vaccines of all kinds but we are not out of the woods yet we can hear the drumming hooves of the cavalry coming over the brow of the hill but they are not here yet Even if all three vaccines are approved, even if the production timetables are met and vaccines notoriously fall behind in their production timetables it will be months before we can be sure that we have inoculated everyone that needs a vaccine and those months will be hard they will be cold they include January and February when the NHS is under its greatest pressure and that is why when we come out of lockdown next week we must not just throw away the gains we have all made So today we have published out Covid Winter Plan which sets out a clear strategy to take the country through to the end of March We will continue to bear down hard on this virus we will use tough tiering - in some ways tougher than the pre-lockdown measures and details of those tiers are on the gov.uk website later this week when we have the most up to data and we will be sharing details of which tier your area is going to be in I should warn you now that many more places will be in higher tiers than alas was previously the case and we will simultaneously be using the new and exciting possibilities of community testing - as they have done in Liverpool and there will be a clear incentive for everyone in areas where the virus prevalence is high to get a test, to get one of these rapid turnaround lateral flow tests and do your best for the community get a test to help to squeeze the disease and reduce the restrictions that your town or city or area has endured and that way - through tough tiering and mass community testing we hope to let people see a little more of their family and friends over Christmas Now I know that many of us want and need Christmas with our families we feel after this year we deserve it but this is not the moment to let the virus rip for the sake of Christmas parties tis the season to be jolly but tis also the season to be jolly careful especially with elderly relatives and working with the Devolved Administrations we will set out shortly how we want to get the balance right for Christmas and we will be setting this out later this week Christmas this year will be different and we want to remain prudent through Christmas and beyond into the new year but we will use the three tools that I have described to squeeze the virus in the weeks and months ahead tiering, testing and the roll-out of vaccines employing all three techniques together so as to drive down R and drive down the infection rate and I really am now assured things really will look and feel very different indeed after Easter and that idea of and end goal or date is important because at last - if the promise of the vaccines is fulfilled - we do have something to work for a timescale, a goal around which businesses can begin tentatively to plan and with luck and with hard work we will be seeing improvements before then but for now the problem is not a shortage of hope or a lack of optimism not with the amazing news that we are getting from the laboratories in this country the challenge now as we face this difficult winter ahead is to fight down any over-optimism to master any tendency to premature celebration of success that success will come all the faster if we work together to follow the guidance maintain the basic disciplines as people have done so heroically over the last few months hands, face, space and get a test if you have symptoms because that is the way we will beat it together 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, thank you and with permission, I will update the House on the Government’s Integrated Review of foreign, defence, security and development policy. Our Review will conclude early next year, setting out the UK’s international agenda, but I want to inform the House of its first outcome. For decades, British governments have trimmed and cheese-pared our defence budget and if we go on like this, we risk waking up to discover that our armed forces – the pride of Britain – have fallen below the minimum threshold of viability, and once lost, they could never be regained. That outcome would not only be craven, it would jeopardise the security of the British people, amounting to a dereliction of duty for any Prime Minister. So I refused to vindicate any pessimistic forecasters there have been by taking up the scalpel yet again. Based on our assessment of the international situation and our foreign policy goals, I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end – and it ends now. I am increasing defence spending by £24.1 billion over the next four years, That’s £16.5 billion more than our manifesto commitment - raising it as a share of GDP to at least 2.2 percent, exceeding our NATO pledge, and investing £190 billion over the next four years, more than any other European country and more than any other NATO ally, except the United States. The Ministry of Defence has received a multi-year settlement because equipping our armed forces requires long term investment, and our national security in 20 years’ time will depend on decisions we take today. I have done this in the teeth of the pandemic, amid every other demand on our resources, because the defence of the realm, and the safety of the British people, must come first. I pay tribute to my Right Honourable Friends the Chancellor and Defence Secretary, who believe in this as fervently as I do. Reviving our armed forces is one pillar of the Government’s ambition to safeguard Britain’s interests and values by strengthening our global influence, and reinforcing our ability to join the United States and our other allies to defend free and open societies. The international situation is now more perilous and intensely competitive than at any time since the Cold War. Everything we do in this country – every job, every business, even how we shop and what we eat – depends on a basic minimum of global security. Our people are sustained by a web of lifelines, oxygen pipes that must be kept open open shipping lanes, a functioning internet, safe air corridors, reliable undersea cables, and tranquillity in distant straits. This pandemic has offered a taste of what happens when elemental requirements are suddenly in question. We could take all this for granted, ignore the threat of terrorism and the ambitions of hostile states, and hope for the best, and we might get away with it for a while, before calamity strikes, as it surely would. Or we could accept that our lifelines must be protected, but we are content to curl up in our island and leave the task to our friends. My starting point is that either of those options would be an abdication of the first duty of Government to defend our people. My choice – and I hope it will carry every member of this House – is that Britain must be true to our history, To stand alongside our allies, sharing the burden and bringing our expertise to bear on the world’s toughest problems. To achieve this, we need to upgrade our capabilities across the board. We have already united our international effort into a new department combining aid and diplomacy, Led with grit and purpose by my RH Friend the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Secretary. Next year will be a year of British leadership, when we preside over the G7, host COP-26 in Glasgow and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the first United Nations General Assembly in London. We are leading the world towards net zero with our ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, and we are campaigning for our values, particularly freedom of religion and the media, and giving every girl in the world access to 12 years of quality education. But extending British influence requires a once-in-a-generation modernisation of our armed forces, and now is the right time to press ahead because emerging technologies, visible on the horizon, will make the returns from defence investment infinitely greater. We have a chance to break free from the vicious circle, whereby we ordered ever-decreasing numbers of ever more expensive items of military hardware, squandering billions along the way. The latest advances will multiply the fighting power of every warship, aircraft and infantry unit many times over, and the prizes will go to the swiftest and most agile nations, not necessarily the biggest. We can achieve as much as British ingenuity and expertise allow. We will need to act speedily to remove or reduce less relevant capabilities – and this will allow our new investment to be focused on the technologies that will revolutionise warfare, forging our military assets into a single network designed to overcome the enemy. A soldier in hostile territory will be alerted to a distant ambush by sensors on satellites or drones, instantly transmitting a warning, using Artificial Intelligence to devise the optimal response, and offering an array of options, from summoning an air strike to ordering a swarm attack, by drones or paralysing the enemy with cyber weapons. New advances will surmount the old limits of logistics. Our warships and combat vehicles will carry “directed energy weapons”, destroying targets with inexhaustible lasers and for them the phrase “out of ammunition” will become redundant. Nations are racing to master this new doctrine of warfare and our investment is designed to place Britain among the winners. The returns will go far beyond our Armed Forces. From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications, opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year – 40,000 in total - levelling up across our country and reinforcing our Union. We shall use our extra defence spending to restore Britain’s position as the foremost naval power in Europe, taking forward our plans for eight Type 26 and five Type 31 frigates, and support ships to supply our carriers. We are going to develop the next generation of warships, including multi-role research vessels and Type 32 frigates. And this will spur a renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK – in Glasgow and Rosyth, Belfast, Appledore and Birkenhead – guaranteeing jobs and illuminating the benefits of the Union in the white light of the arc welder’s torch. If there was one policy which strengthens the UK in every possible sense, it is building more ships for the Royal Navy. Once both of our carriers are operational in 2023, the UK will have a Carrier Strike Group permanently available, routinely deployed globally and always ready to fight alongside NATO and other allies. Next year HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades, encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia. We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation, and we shall press on with renewing our nuclear deterrent. We shall reshape our army for the age of networked warfare, allowing better equipped soldiers to deploy more quickly, and strengthening the ability of our Special Forces to operate covertly against our most sophisticated adversaries. Our security and intelligence agencies will continue to protect us around the clock from terrorism and new and evolving threats, We shall invest another £1.5 billion in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare, and we will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and a new RAF Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022. I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel, which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity. And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat. Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe. The defence of the realm is above party politics and we all take pride in how British resolve saved democracy in 1940, and British internationalism – directed by Clement Attlee - helped to create NATO and preserve peace through the Cold War. The wisdom and pragmatism of Margaret Thatcher found a path out of confrontation when she met Mikhail Gorbachev in 1984. In each case, Britain tipped the scales of history and did immense good for the world. Now we have a chance to follow in this great tradition, to end the era of retreat, transform our armed forces, bolster our global influence, unite and level up across our country, protect our people, and defend the free societies in which we fervently believe. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 9 November 2020 Across the country and around the world this evening, people are asking one question about our fight against Covid, does the news of progress towards a vaccine – that’s been announced today - mean we are at the beginning of the end of our troubles? So, let me set out our assessment. The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus. But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data, and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed. So we have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used. What I can say is that if and when this vaccine is approved, we, in this country, will be ready to start using it. Earlier this year the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the population, since you need two doses each. That puts us towards the front of the international pack on a per capita basis – and I should add we’ve ordered over 300 million doses from 5 other vaccine candidates as well. If the Pfizer vaccine passes all the rigorous safety checks and is proved to be effective then we will begin a UK-wide NHS led programme of vaccine distribution. We will decide the order in which people are offered the vaccination taking account of recommendations from a group of scientific experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They’re looking at a range of factors, including the different characteristics of different types of vaccines, to work out the most effective way to protect as many people as possible and save as many lives as we can. And we will be setting out more detail about that in due course. But – and you know I am going to say this - I must stress, these are very, very early days. We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill And tonight that toot of the bugle is louder. But it is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution. The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at such a critical moment. On Friday, SAGE reported that the R is above 1 in England – though this does not take into account the current national restrictions. Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days ago The number of Covid patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on 5 November, and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak. Irrespective of whether there is a vaccine on the way or not we must continue to do everything possible right now to bring the R down. And that is why we hope and believe that mass testing will help. Our first pilot began in Liverpool on Friday, in partnership with Liverpool City Council. We’ve tested thousands of people there but there are still a lot more to do, so please if you are in Liverpool, get yourself along to a testing centre – there are 19 at the moment with more still to come. The more people get tested the better we can protect that great city, and drive the disease down in Liverpool so do it for your friends, for your relatives, for your community. And I want to thank the fantastic support of the army, the people of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council. And we are now going further by sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England - and also of course to the Devolved Administrations. We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country. But while we are making progress this project is still in its infancy. And neither mass testing nor progress on vaccines –both vital arrows in our epidemiological quiver, both key parts of our fight against Covid - are at the present time a substitute for the national restrictions, for social distancing, for hand hygiene and all the rest. So it is all the more important to follow the rules. I know it’s been a tough first weekend of these Autumn restrictions and I’m especially grateful to the Royal British Legion and all those who worked so hard to ensure that no virus would stop us yesterday from honouring the memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. But we must get through this to 2nd December, when these measures expire and we plan to move forward with a tiered approach. Remember the basics, hands, face, space, and the follow the rules, that is how we can together protect our NHS, save lives and get this virus back in its box. And that is what we will do. So thank you. And I’m now going to hand over to Brigadier Fossey to talk about how the unrivalled logistical expertise of the British army that’s helping to deliver mass testing to Liverpool. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 5 November 2020 Good evening everyone, Across the whole United Kingdom, people are engaged in a huge joint effort to put the coronavirus back in its box.
Throughout the pandemic, this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods – in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have put in place an unprecedented package of economic support, protecting the wages and jobs of millions of people. We have built the largest testing capacity in Europe, with 32 million tests conducted so far and over half a million tests now available every day across the UK. We have ensured that, as we head into winter, the NHS has at its disposal over 30,000 ventilators and billions of items of Personal Protective Equipment, most of it now manufactured here in the UK. Across the whole of the UK, we have a shared goal – to suppress the virus, ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed, and in doing so to save lives. The UK Government and the devolved administrations are working together on a joint approach to the Christmas period, because all of us want to ensure families can come together wherever they live. The challenges we face are significant across the U.K. The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier. There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier. 1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier. Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier. That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK. In England, from today, we are once again asking you to stay at home. As I explained on Saturday you can only leave home for specific reasons: for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies. The full rules, all of the details, are available at gov.uk/coronavirus and on the NHS Covid-19 app – please log on to see what you can and can’t do. I know how tough this is: For staff in the NHS and care homes, who are facing a tough winter on the frontline. For families, who can’t meet in the way they would want to. For businesses, forced to shut just as you are getting back on their feet. I know many of you are anxious, weary and quite frankly fed up with the very mention of this virus But I want to assure you this is not a repeat of the spring. Schools, universities and nurseries are all staying open. And these measures though they are tough are time-limited. The advice I have received suggests that four weeks is enough for these measures to make a real impact. So these rules will expire, and on 2 December we plan to move back to a tiered approach. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We have better treatments and techniques to take care of those in hospital, thanks largely to the ingenuity of British scientists. Rapid testing is being rolled out on a massive scale – with city-wide testing starting tomorrow in Liverpool. I am hugely grateful to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot. I hope that by working together, we can get that great city on top of the virus. More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines. So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead. And in the meantime, the government will continue to support people affected by these new restrictions. As you know, we have protected almost 10 million jobs through furlough, and as the Chancellor announced earlier today, we are now extending the scheme through to March. We are also extending our support for the self-employed, so that the next payment increases to 80 per cent of average profits. We’re providing cash grants for businesses who are closed, worth more than £1 billion every month. We are giving £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England to support businesses. And a further £2 billion of funding is guaranteed for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As we face these challenges together, we must look after those in most need. As of September we have helped over 29,000 rough sleepers off the streets, two thirds of whom are now in settled accommodation. Today we’re announcing a further £15 million to help councils offer safe accommodation for people who are sleeping rough or at risk of becoming homeless. This programme will help areas that need additional support most during the restrictions and throughout the winter. These are difficult times. And while it pains me to have to ask once again for so many to give up so much, I know that, together, we can get through this. So please, for the next four weeks, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. I’ll now hand over to the Head of NHS England Simon Stevens who’s going to talk about the NHS’s preparations for winter. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move that these Regulations are approved and that we come together today to implement time-limited restrictions across England from midnight, so we can contain the Autumn surge of the virus,
protect our NHS and save many lives. Of course, this not something that any of us wanted to do. None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, To furlough their staff, or stay away from their friends and family. And I feel the pain and anxiety that we all share in the month ahead. But as Prime Minister, when I am confronted with data that projects our NHS could even collapse, with deaths in this second wave potentially exceeding those of the first; and when I look at what is happening now amongst some of our continental friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered alas to work on covid wards,
and patients airlifted to hospitals in some other countries simply to make space, I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people. And I know, Mr Speaker, it might be tempting to think that because some progress has been made we just need to stay the course and see through our locally led approach. And it is true that the extraordinary efforts of millions across the country especially those in high and very high alert level areas – they have made a difference, Mr Speaker suppressing the R, the reproduction rate of the virus below where it would have otherwise have been And I want to record again my thanks again to the millions who have put up with local restrictions, and I want to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. But I am sorry to say that the number of Covid patients in some hospitals is already higher than at the peak of the first wave. Even in the South West, which has so far had lower case rates than most of the rest of the country, hospital admissions are over half way to their first wave peak. SAGE’s latest analysis, published on Friday, suggests that the R remains above 1 in every part of England,
which means the virus is continuing to grow among the population. And every day that the number is above one, is another day that the number of cases will rise locking in, more hospital admissions and alas more fatalities. and pushing the NHS ever closer to the moment when it cannot cope. The course we have before us is to prevent the R from going back remaining above one and to get it down. Otherwise we face a bleak and an uncertain future of steadily rising infections and admissions until as I say the capacity of the NHS is breached. And I know there has been some debate about the projections from some of these models, for example, exactly how big the loss of life might be, or the precise point at which the NHS might be overwhelmed, but all the scientific experts that I have talked to are unanimous on one point As the Chief Medical Officer has said –
“if we did not act now, then the chance of the NHS being in extraordinary trouble in December would be very, very high.” And be in no doubt Mr Speaker what that means for our country and for our society. It means that the precious principle - of care for everyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – that principal could be shattered for the first time in our experience It means those who are sick and suffering and in need of help - could be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals Mr Speaker even in East Sussex Mr Speaker. Doctors and nurses could be forced to make impossible choices about which patients would live and would die, who would get oxygen and who couldn’t. And I know that there are some Members like my honourable friend who are hearing from their local hospitals that the pressure is not that great yet. But the whole point about a National Health Service, is that when hospitals in one part of the country are over-run,
sick patients are transferred to another, until the whole system falls over. And let me be clear this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, as is sometimes asserted but from not focusing enough. Because if we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would not only lead to the covid casualties that I’ve described but which would deprive other patients of the care they need. We simply cannot reach the point where our National Health Service is no longer there for everyone. And Mr Speaker this fate is not inevitable. We are moving to these national measures here when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were for instance in France, when President Macron took similar steps. If we act now and act decisively we can stem the rising waters before our defences are breached. And this approach, these regulations I do believe are the way we can do that. Mr Speaker, I know there are many in the House who are concerned about how long these measures might last, and that if people vote for these regulations today, they could suddenly find that we are trapped with these national measures for months on end. So let me level with the House. Of course, I cannot say exactly where the epidemiology will be by 2nd December, But what I can say is that the national measures – that I hope the House will vote on tonight - are time-limited. It is not that we choose to stop them. They legally expire. So whatever we decide to do from 2nd December will require a fresh mandate and a fresh vote from this House. And as I have made clear, it is my express intent that we should return to a tiered system on a local and a regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Mr Speaker, the whole House will share my sorrow and regret at the necessity of these measures,
particularly for businesses who had just got back on their feet Mr Speaker, who had done their level best to make themselves Covid-secure,
installing handwashing stations, plexiglass screens, one-way systems And as the Chancellor has set out, we will do whatever it takes to support them. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13 billion to help support the self-employed, and we are now doubling our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits for the self-employed for this month. We’re providing cash grants of up to £3,000 per month for businesses who are closed - worth over £1 billion a month and benefiting over 600,000 business premises. We are giving funding of £1.1 billion to Local Authorities in England, to further support businesses and their local economy in the winter months. And this comes on top of the more than £200 billion we’ve provided since March. And we will also ensure that throughout this period that our schools stay open. We will not allow this virus to do any further damage to the future of our children. I said in the Summer we had a moral duty to reopen our schools as soon as it was safe to do so and that they would be the last element of society to close down again. And we have stuck to that pledge Mr Speaker Our schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings. Mr Speaker, the measures before the House are designed to arrest the virus, to drive it down and to get on top of it once and for all. If we are able to test on a big enough scale to identify the people who are infected – often without symptoms and who unwittingly, asymptomatically pass the virus to others then those people will be helped immediately – this is the key thing - to self-isolate and break the chains of transmission, and reducing the spread of the virus –reducing the number of people in hospital, reducing the number of people dying. I think that if we all play our part in this system it could be a hugely valuable weapon in our fight against Covid in the short medium and long term, and an alternative to the blanket restrictions that have been imposed in so many parts of the world. We are piloting this week a mass test in Liverpool, where an immense effort benefiting from the logistical skill of the armed services will offer everyone a test. And our aim is to make mass and repeated testing available for everyone across the country. Thanks to the pioneering work of British scientists, we already have a life-saving treatment for Covid and the genuine possibility of a safe and effective vaccine next year. Taken together, these achievements provide every reason for confidence that our country can and will pull through this crisis and that our ingenuity will prove equal to the challenge. Mr Speaker, this year I and the whole government has asked much of the British people. More than any Prime Minister I believe has asked of the British people in peacetime. And I have to say that the public have responded magnificently and selflessly. Putting their lives on hold, bearing any burden, overcoming every obstacle and tolerating every disruption and inconvenience no matter how large or small or inconsistent Mr Speaker so that they can do the right thing by their fellow citizens. I wish that it had been enough to defeat this Autumn surge. But while I am more optimistic now, more optimistic about the medium and long-term future than I have been for many months, there can be no doubt that the situation before us today is grave, and the need for action acute. It is absolutely right for this House – for members on all sides of this House- to have the doubts that have been expressed, to seek answers from me and to provide scrutiny. That is the purpose and duty of the House of Commons. But, while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy. So now is the time for us to put our differences aside and focus on the next four weeks, getting this virus back to its box. And I know that, once again, our amazing country will respond to adversity by doing what is right – staying at home, protecting the NHS, and saving lives. And in that spirit, I commend these regulations to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker with your permission, I will make a statement on the measures we must now take to contain the autumn surge of Coronavirus, protect our NHS and save lives. On Saturday evening the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser described the remorseless advance of this second wave. The extraordinary efforts being made by millions of people across the country especially by those in very high alert areas have made a real difference, suppressing the R rate below where it would otherwise have been. But the R is still above one in every part of England as it is across much of Europe and the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario. There are already more Covid patients in some hospitals now than at the height of the first wave, 2,000 more this Sunday than last Sunday. While the prevalence of the virus is worse in parts of the North, the doubling time in the South East and the Midlands is now faster than in the North West. Even in the South West, where incidence remains low, current projections mean they will start to run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks. And the modelling presented by our scientists suggests that without action, we could see up to twice as many deaths over the winter as we saw in the first wave. Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level. I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership. And I reject any idea that we are somehow slower in taking measures than our European friends and partners. In fact, we are moving to national measures when the rate both of deaths and infections is lower than they were in France. We are engaged in a constant struggle to protect lives and livelihoods, and we must balance the restrictions we introduce against the long term scars they leave, whether for businesses and jobs, or our physical and mental health. No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential, so it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low. I want to thank the millions who have put up with local restrictions, sometimes for months on end. I want to thank them, and to thank the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position. And we will continue as far as possible to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead. But we are fighting a disease Mr Speaker, and when the data changes course, we must change course too. To those in this House who believe we should resist further national measures, let me spell out the medical and moral disaster we face. If we allow our health system to be overwhelmed – exactly as the data now suggests – then that would not only be a disaster for thousands of Covid patients, because their survival rates would fall, we would also reach a point where the NHS was no longer there for everyone. The sick would be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals. That sacred principle - of care for anyone who needs it, whoever they are and whenever they need it – could be broken for the first time in our lives. Doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die. And this existential threat to our NHS comes not from focusing too much on Coronavirus, but from not focusing enough. If we fail to get Coronavirus under control, it is the sheer weight of demand from Covid patients that would deprive others of the care they need. Cancer treatment, heart surgery, other life-saving procedures: all this could be put at risk if we do not get the virus under control. And even though we are so much better prepared than before, with stockpiles of PPE and ventilators, the Nightingales on standby, and 13,000 more nurses than last year, I am afraid the virus is doubling faster than we could ever conceivably add capacity. Even if we doubled capacity, the gain would be consumed in a single doubling of the virus. And so on Wednesday the House will vote on regulations which, if passed, will mean that from Thursday until 2nd December, in England, people will only be permitted to leave home for specific reasons, including: 
For education;
For work, if you cannot work from home;
For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own, or with one person from another household or support bubble;
For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury and harm;
To shop for food and essentials
And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer.

Essential shops will remain open and click and collect services will continue, so people do not need to stock up. But I am afraid that non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues and the personal care sector will all be closed. Hospitality must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Places of worship can open for individual prayer, funerals and formal childcare but sadly not for services. However Remembrance Sunday events can go ahead, provided they are held outside, and observe social distancing. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in construction or manufacturing. Elite sport will also be able to continue. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. The clinically vulnerable and those over 60 should minimise their contact with others. And while we will not ask people to shield again in the same way, the clinically extremely vulnerable should only work from home. Mr Speaker, I am truly sorry for the anguish these measures will impose, particularly for businesses which had just got back on their feet, businesses across the country who have gone to such trouble to make themselves Covid secure, to install Perspex screens, to do the right thing. Each of these actions has helped to bring the R down, and their hard work and your hard work will stand them in good stead, but for now it is clear that we must do more together. So the government will continue to do everything possible to support jobs and livelihoods in the next four weeks as we have throughout. We have protected almost 10 million jobs with furlough, and we are now extending this scheme throughout November. We have already paid out £13.7 billion to help the self-employed, and I can announce today that for November we will double our support from 40 to 80 per cent of trading profits. My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor will also extend the deadline for applications to Covid loan schemes from the end of this month to the end of next to ensure that small businesses can access additional loans if required. We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April, and there are ways in which these measures are less prohibitive. We have for instance a moral duty to keep schools open now that it is safe to do so, because we must not allow this virus to damage our children’s futures. So schools will remain open, as will colleges, universities, childcare and early years settings - and I am pleased this will command support Mr Speaker across the House. It is also vital that we continue provision for non-Covid healthcare so people should turn up to use the NHS, to get their scans, turn up for appointments and collect their treatments. Mr Speaker let me stress that these restrictions are time limited. After four weeks, on Wednesday 2nd December, they will expire and we intend to return to a tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends, and the House will have a vote to agree the way forward. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and will continue to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. And while scientists are bleak in their predictions over the short-term, they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and long-term. And if the House asks me Mr Speaker what is the exit strategy, what is the way out – let me be as clear as I can: it is to get the R down now – to beat this autumn surge and to use this moment to exploit the medical and technical advances we are making to keep it low. We now have not only much better medication and the prospect of a vaccine the immediate prospect of many millions of cheap, reliable and rapid turnaround tests – with a result in minutes. Trials have already shown that we can help suppress the disease in hospitals, schools and universities by testing large numbers of NHS workers, children, teachers and students. These tests, crucially, identify people who are infectious but do not have symptoms, allowing them immediately to self-isolate and stop the spread of the disease, and allowing those who are not infectious to continue as normal. This means that, unlike in the spring, it’s possible to keep these institutions open and still stop the spread of the disease. And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests which we will be manufacturing in this country applying them in an ever-growing number of situations, from helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth, to testing whole towns and even cities. The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days. Mr Speaker, we have dexamethasone – the first validated life-saving treatment for the disease, pioneered in this country. We have the real prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year and we have ever more sophisticated means of providing virtually instant tests. I believe that these technical developments, taken together, will enable us to defeat this virus by the spring, as humanity has defeated every other infectious disease. And I am not alone in this optimism but I cannot pretend that the way ahead is easy, or without painful choices for us all. And so for the next four weeks I must ask the people of this country to come together, to protect the NHS, and to save many thousands of lives. And Mr Speaker I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Good evening and apologies for disturbing your Saturday evening with more news of Covid and I can assure you I wouldn’t do it unless it was absolutely necessary. First I will hand over to Chris and then Patrick who will present the latest data. 
Data Presentation 
Thank you very much Patrick, and Chris. I am afraid that no responsible PM can ignore the message of those figures. When I told you two weeks ago that we were pursuing a local and a regional approach to tackling this virus, I believed then and I still believe passionately that it was the right thing to do. Because we know the cost of these restrictions, the damage they do, the impact on jobs, and on livelihoods, and on people’s mental health. No one wants to be imposing these kinds of measures anywhere. We didn’t want to be shutting businesses, pubs and restaurants in one part of the country, where incidence was very low, when the vast bulk of infections were taking place elsewhere. Our hope was that by strong local action, strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down where the disease was surging, and address the problem thereby across the whole country. And I want to thank the millions of people who have been putting up with these restrictions in their areas for so long. I want to thank local leaders who have stepped up and local communities. Because as you can see from some of those charts, the R has been kept lower than it would otherwise have been, and there are signs that your work has been paying off And we will continue as far as we possibly can to adopt a pragmatic and local approach in the months ahead But as we’ve also seen from those charts, we’ve got to be humble in the face of nature And in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisers Whose models as you’ve just seen now suggest that unless we act we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day A peak of mortality alas far bigger than the one we saw in April Even in the South West, where incidence was so low, and still is so low, it is now clear that current projections mean they will run out of hospital capacity in a matter of weeks unless we act. And let me explain why the overrunning of the NHS would be a medical and moral disaster beyond the raw loss of life Because the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat Who would get oxygen and who wouldn’t Who would live and who would die, And doctors and nurses would be forced to choose between saving covid patients and non-covid patients And the sheer weight of covid demand would mean depriving tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of non-covid patients of the care they need It is crucial to grasp this that the general threat to public health comes not from focusing too much on covid, but from not focusing enough, from failing to get it under control And if we let the lines on those graphs grow in the way they could and in the way they’re projected to grow, then the risk is that for the first time in our lives, the NHS will not be there for us and for our families And even if I could now double capacity overnight – and obviously I am proud that we have massively increased capacity, we do have the Nightingales, we’ve got 13,000 more nurses now than last year, we have many more doctors – but it still would not be enough, because the virus is doubling faster than we could conceivably add capacity And so now is the time to take action because there is no alternative. From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home. You may only leave home for specific reasons, including: For education;
For work, say if you cannot work from home;
For exercise and recreation outdoors, with your household or on your own with one person from another household;
For medical reasons, appointments and to escape injury or harm;
To shop for food and essentials;
And to provide care for vulnerable people, or as a volunteer. I’m afraid non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues will all be closed – though click and collect services can continue and essential shops will remain open, so there is no need to stock up. Pubs, bars, restaurants must close except for takeaway and delivery services. Workplaces should stay open where people can’t work from home – for example in the construction or manufacturing sectors. Single adult households can still form exclusive support bubbles with one other household, and children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated. If you are clinically vulnerable, or over the age of 60, you should be especially careful to follow the rules and minimise your contacts with others. I know how tough shielding was, and we will not ask people to shield again in the same way again. However we are asking those who are clinically extremely vulnerable to minimise their contact with others, and not to go to work if they are unable to work from home. I am under no illusions about how difficult this will be for businesses which have already had to endure hardship this year. I am truly, truly sorry for that. This is why we are also going to extend the furlough system through November. The furlough scheme was a success in the spring. It supported people and businesses in a critical time. We will not end it. We will extend it until December. There will be some differences compared to March. These measures above all will be time-limited, starting next Thursday 5 November. They will end on Wednesday 2 December, when we will seek to ease restrictions, going back into the tiered system on a local and regional basis according to the latest data and trends. Christmas is going to be different this year, very different, but it is my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together. My priority, our priority, remains keeping people in education - so childcare, early years settings, schools, colleges and universities will all remain open. Our senior clinicians still advise that school is the best place for children to be. We cannot let this virus damage our children’s futures even more than it has already. I urge parents to continue taking their children to school and I am extremely grateful to teachers across the country for their dedication in enabling schools to remain open. And it is vital that we will keep provision for non-Covid healthcare groups going. So please - this is really important - unless your clinicians tell you otherwise, you should continue to use the NHS, get your scans, turn up for your appointments and pick up your treatments. If at all possible, we want you to continue to access these services, now and through the winter. Indeed it’s only by taking this action that we can protect the NHS for you. On Monday I will set out our plans to parliament. On Wednesday, parliament will debate and vote on these measures which, if passed, will as I say come into force on Thursday. We have updated the devolved administrations on the action we are taking in England and stand ready to work with them on plans for Christmas and beyond. We should remember we are not alone in what we’re going through. Our friends in Belgium, France and Germany have had to take very similar action. So as we come together now to fight this second wave, I want to say something about the way ahead Because people will reasonably ask when will this all end And as I have said before I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests Tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes And we know from trial across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the disease And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests Applying them in an ever-growing number of situations From helping women to have their partners with them in labour wards when they’re giving birth to testing whole towns and even whole cities The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days Working with local communities, local government, public health directors and organisations of all kinds to help people discover whether or not they are infectious, and then immediately to get them to self-isolate and to stop the spread And I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options But they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long term future We will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surge We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April It is less prohibitive and less restrictive But from Thursday the basic message is the same Stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 22 October I am very glad to be joined today not just by Sir Patrick Vallance but by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak who is going to tell us more in a moment about our latest package to help this country in its battle with Covid. And I want to thank Rishi for measures that will protect people’s livelihoods and protect jobs and which will help us to deliver our overwhelming objective of getting the virus under control while keeping pupils in education and keeping the UK economy moving forward. I know that there are some people who will say that this economic objective is so important that we should stop all measures to control the virus and stop restrictions of any kind on our social lives or on the way we run our businesses. We can’t do that because alas the maths is inescapable. We would face many thousands more deaths. And no, to answer one commonly posed question, we would not be able to insulate the elderly and the vulnerable. Not in a society with so many multigenerational households. No country has been able to do that. And an uncontrolled expansion in the number of Covid patients would mean that the NHS would have even less capacity to treat heart patients and cancer patients and to deal with all our other medical needs. So that’s why we reject that extreme laissez-faire approach. And then there are others who say on the contrary that we need now to lock the whole place down from John O’ Groats to Lands’ End. Turn the lights out, shut up shop. Close schools and universities and go back to the same kind of lockdown we had in March and April and May. And I have to say I don’t believe that is the right course now. Not when the psychological cost of lockdown is well known to us and the economic cost. Not when it is being suggested that we might have to perform the same brutal lockdown again and again in the months ahead. And not when there is such obvious variation – unlike last time – between different parts of the country. So that’s why we are going for a balanced approach. A middle course between the Scylla of another national lockdown and the Charybdis of an uncontrolled virus. A regional and local approach - the same approach that is now being followed by some of the countries that are the most successful in their fights against the virus. And so to all those who are enduring these restrictions, and who have been enduring them for so long in all parts of the country. I want to repeat my thanks, for your bravery, for your patience and your public spiritedness. And I repeat – there are clear signs that our collective actions are working. Yes the R is above one, but thanks to the efforts of people of all ages in following the guidance and the rules the R is about half its natural rate. And if we follow the guidance together and follow the rules then we can get it down. And it is precisely because these measures are burdensome that from the beginning this government has provided unprecedented support to everyone in this country –  support worth £200bn to look after jobs and livelihoods and business. And as we adjust our campaign to fight the virus it is right that we should now produce a new package of support across the country in addition to the specific agreements we have reached with Lancashire, Merseyside and others. And because it is far, far better to keep business going now rather than to let those jobs go forever in a new national lockdown. We will win this fight against Covid. Because we can see that treatments are getting better, and medicines are getting better and testing technologies are getting better. And we have shown before that we can drive the R down. And in the meantime we need to protect jobs, protect livelihoods, and put the UK in strongest position for an economic recovery. I am now going to hand over to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. 

Boris:


Good afternoon, I am joined this afternoon by Dr Susan Hopkins of NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England and Sir Patrick Vallance Chief Scientific Advisor. On Monday, I explained that we would seek to consult with mayors and local authorities in areas moving into the Very High alert level. I am grateful to all those in local government in hotspot areas who have been working with us over the last week on how to control the virus in their areas. In particular, I would like to thank Steve Rotheram in Merseyside, Sadiq Khan in London and local leaders in Lancashire who have worked constructively with us. In Merseyside, where the situation is most acute, we were able to conclude talks quickly. In London, we have worked with the Mayor to respond to rising infections across the capital as well as particular spikes in some boroughs. And in Lancashire today, we have worked with both Labour and Conservative leaders to agree a package. These were tough discussions, difficult decisions. No one wants to have to implement these measures which damage local businesses, curtail individual freedom and impose significant strains on people’s mental health. But these decisions were necessary because of the rate of increase not just of infections but also in hospitalisations and admissions to intensive care. Without action, there is no doubt that our NHS would soon be struggling to treat the sheer number of people seriously ill with Covid. Non-Covid treatments and surgeries would need to be cancelled in order to cope. And many more people would die. So taking action is the right and responsible thing to do. And it is backed up by significant support for areas on Very High alert: 

The Job Support Scheme, combined with Universal Credit, means that those on low incomes who are affected by business closures will receive at least 80% of their wages. 

We are providing up to £465 million to help Very High alert level areas to implement and enforce the restrictions, in addition to the £1 billion of extra funding for local authorities across the country. 

We will work with local authorities to allocate testing and introduce local contact tracing. 

Now, we have not yet reached an agreement with Greater Manchester. I completely understand the reluctance of the Mayor and his colleagues to take Manchester into the Very High alert level. It is far from a pain-free course of action and it will mean a difficult time for the people of that great part of the country – on top of the restrictions they have already had to endure since the summer. But I must stress, the situation in Greater Manchester is grave, and it worsens with each passing day. Cases doubled in the last 9 days. High infection rates are creeping up the age range: while cases are 690 per 100,000 for 16-29 year olds, they have now risen to 224 per 100,000 for the over-60s. The number of COVID in-patients in Manchester’s ICU beds is already over 40% of the number at the height of the first wave. That number will inevitably rise further, given that hospitalisation occurs 2-3 weeks after infection. On present trends, in just over 2 weeks there will be more Covid patients in intensive care than at the peak of the first wave. So I urge the Mayor to reconsider and engage constructively. I cannot stress enough – time is of the essence. Each day that passes before action is taken means more people will go to hospital, more people will end up in intensive care, and tragically more people will die. Of course if agreement cannot be reached, I will need to intervene in order to protect Manchester’s hospitals and to save the lives of Manchester’s residents. But our efforts will be so much more effective if we work together. Some have argued that we should introduce a national lockdown instead of targeted local action and I disagree. Closing businesses in Cornwall, where transmission is low, will not cut transmission in Manchester. So while I cannot rule anything out, if at all possible I want to avoid another national lockdown, with the damaging health, economic and social effects it would have. Alongside our local strategy we have been working throughout to find other ways to suppress this virus. We are backing our brilliant scientists leading the global effort to find a safe and effective vaccine. We have also secured early access to over 350 million vaccine doses through a portfolio of promising new vaccines to ensure we are in the best place, and we are taking every possible step to ensure we can move as quickly as possible to deploy a vaccine if and when one is found to work. And we’ve created a huge diagnostics industry from scratch, scaling up the ability to test from 2,000 in February to more than 300,000 today. I also want to update on our future approach to testing. We are now testing more people than any other country in Europe but we always want to go further. One of the most dangerous aspects of this disease is that people without any symptoms can infect many others without realising it. If we can catch more asymptomatic people before they unknowingly pass on the disease to the vulnerable, we can help to stop the virus’ vicious spread. So far it has been difficult to do this. But that is changing. Scientists and companies in Britain and around the world have been developing new tests which are faster, simpler and cheaper. They have been working hard to discover and evaluate new testing technologies. Though there is work to do, It’s becoming clear over the past few weeks that some of these new tests are highly effective and can help us save lives and jobs over winter. We have already bought millions of these tests, some of which are very simple – meaning you simply need to wipe the swab inside your mouth – and can give a result as quickly as in 15 minutes. Some of these fast tests work with saliva and we are already using these in hospitals. We have started building the infrastructure for domestic manufacture of these tests, ensuring that Britain has the ability to produce millions of fast tests here. Over the next few weeks we will start distributing and trialling these tests across the country. This will enable us to do quick turnaround tests on NHS and care home staff much more frequently. By testing more frequently and quickly than ever before, we can hope we can help prevent the virus entering and spreading through care homes. And we will be able to test students in universities with outbreaks, as well as children in schools, helping us to keep education open safely through the winter. And we will make tests available to local directors of public health to help control localised outbreaks - handing more control from London to all parts of our country so that those on the ground can use the tools we give them as they think best. And I have instructed my team to ensure that Liverpool City Region, Lancashire, and any other areas which enter into the Very High alert level are immediately prioritised for those tests. This will make a big difference in how we protect people from this disease. But it’s vital that we all take a cautious approach to this new technology. First, it will take time to develop this plan. No country in the world is regularly testing millions of people, so we need to take the time to establish how to do this effectively and safely, and to build the logistics and distribution operation necessary for a large-scale operation across the country. Second, we won’t be able to use testing to get business back to normal quickly. In time, we want to use tests to open, and keep open, more parts of the economy that have sadly been closed. But it is crucial that we make sure such systems work safely and I must level with you that it will take time to get this right before many organisations can buy and operate these tests themselves. Third, this will need a huge effort across the country, and we will need hospitals, care homes schools, universities and other organisations to work with us as we develop this plan. But the most important thing is that people isolate if they test positive. If you test positive with one of these fast new tests, then you must stay at home. If everyone follows the rule and self-isolates if you have symptoms, get a positive test, or have come into contact with someone who has the virus, we will suppress the disease. And we must all remember that this virus thrives on human contact. So we must do everything in our power to limit its spread. Always think: Hands Face Space, ventilate your buildings, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, keep your distance from others. And make sure - as I say - you improve ventilation when spending time indoors. If we all do these simple things we’ll protect each other from the virus and we will defeat it together. I’ll hand over to Patrick Valance who will run through the latest data and we’ll then go to your questions. Sir Patrick. 

Boris:


Good morning, We left the EU on January 31 and delivered on the largest democratic mandate in the history of this country. And since then we have been in a transition period obeying EU law, paying our fees – as a non-voting member – working on the future relationship we hope to enjoy with our friends and partners from January. And from the outset we were totally clear that we wanted nothing more complicated than a Canada-style relationship, based on friendship and free trade. To judge by the latest EU summit in Brussels that won’t work for our EU partners. They want the continued ability to control our legislative freedom, our fisheries, in a way that is obviously unacceptable to an independent country. And since we have only ten weeks until the end of the transition period on January 1, I have to make a judgment about the likely outcome and to get us all ready. And given that they have refused to negotiate seriously for much of the last few months, and given that this summit appears explicitly to rule out a Canada-style deal, I have concluded that we should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia’s based on simple principles of global free trade. And we can do it, because we always knew that there would be change on January 1 whatever type of relationship we had. And so now is the time for our businesses to get ready, and for hauliers to get ready, and for travellers to get ready. And of course we are willing to discuss the practicalities with our friends where a lot of progress has already been made, by the way, on such issues as social security, and aviation, nuclear cooperation and so on. But for whatever reason it is clear from the summit that after 45 years of membership they are not willing – unless there is some fundamental change of approach – to offer this country the same terms as Canada. And so with high hearts and complete confidence we will prepare to embrace the alternative. And we will prosper mightily as an independent free trading nation, controlling our own borders, our fisheries, and setting our own laws. And in the meantime the government will be focussing on tackling COVID and building back better so that 2021 is a year of recovery and renewal. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


Prime Minister’s statement on coronavirus on 12 October 2020 Good evening everyone. We are entering a new and crucial phase of our fight against Coronavirus. Because the number of cases has gone up four times in four weeks and it is once again spreading among the elderly and vulnerable. There are already more Covid patients in UK hospitals today than there were on 23 March when the whole country went into lockdown and deaths, alas, are also rising once again. These figures are flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet. And we must act now. So we are giving local authorities across England around a billion pounds so they can protect vital services as they fight the virus. Nightingale Hospitals across the North of England are being prepared for service. And so we can squash this virus wherever it appears we are today simplifying, standardising and in some places toughening local rules in England by introducing three levels of Covid Alert. Medium, with existing national measures such as the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. High, with extra measures including a ban on indoor social mixing between households or support bubbles. And Very High, for places where, without further action, the NHS will swiftly be under intolerable pressure. Areas within the Very High Alert category will be reviewed every four weeks and nowhere will be shut down indefinitely. And the exact restrictions at this level, Very High, will be worked out with local leaders, along with tailored packages of support. But at a minimum they will, sadly, include a ban on all social mixing between households in private places, including gardens and pubs and bars must close unless they can operate solely as a restaurant, serving alcohol only as part of a main meal. We will also ask people not to travel into and out of Very High alert level areas. Nobody affected by this will be left to fend for themselves. And we will expand our unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions, extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close, and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks, and extra funding too for those in the Very High category for local test and trace and enforcement. You will shortly be able to type in your postcode into Gov.UK and see exactly what restrictions apply where you live. The majority of the country will, for now, be at medium. Most areas currently under local intervention will be at High, and Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham itself, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move to this level. Over the weekend we have been working with local leaders in areas where the data are most worrying. And from Wednesday, local authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move to the Very High alert level. In addition to pubs and bars we have agreed with Liverpool City mayor Steve Rotheram that gyms, leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will close. We are still working with other local leaders to determine how best to tackle the resurgence of the virus in their areas. But tackle it we will. No one, least of all me, wants to impose these kinds of erosions of our personal liberty, but I am as convinced as I have ever been that the British people have the resolve to beat this virus and that, together, we will do just that. With that I’ll hand over to the Chancellor, who has some more details on how we’ll be supporting these businesses, employees and areas affected by today’s changes. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our continuing fight against coronavirus and how we intend to fulfil our simultaneous objectives saving lives, protecting the NHS while keeping our children in school and our economy running, and protecting jobs and livelihoods This morning the Deputy Chief Medical Officer set out the stark reality of the second wave of this virus the number of cases has quadrupled in the last three weeks there are now more people in hospital with Covid than when we went into lockdown on March 23 and deaths are already rising and of course there are those who say that on that logic we should go back into a full national lockdown of indefinite duration closing schools and businesses telling people again to stay at home as we did in March once again shuttering our lives and our society I do not believe that would be the right course, We would not only be depriving our children of their education we would do such damage to our economy as to erode our long term ability to fund the NHS and other crucial public services And on the other side of the argument there are those who think that the patience of the public is now exhausted and that we should abandon the fight against Covid stand aside, let nature take her course, and call a halt to these repressions of liberty and of course I understand those emotions I understand the frustration of those who have been chafing under the restrictions, the sacrifices they have made But if we were to follow that course Mr Speaker, and let the virus rip, then the bleak mathematics dictate that we would suffer not only an intolerable death toll from Covid, We would put such huge strain on our NHS, with an uncontrolled second spike that our doctors and nurses would be simply unable to devote themselves to the other treatments for cancer, for heart disease and hundreds more that have already been delayed and that would be delayed again with serious long term damage to the health of the nation and I am afraid it is no answer to say that we could let the virus take hold among the young and fit while shielding the elderly and vulnerable because the virus would then spread with such velocity in the general population that there would be no way of stopping it from spreading among the elderly and even if the virus is less lethal for the under 60s there will still be many younger people for whom, alas, it remains lethal So Mr Speaker, we don’t want to go back to another national lockdown We can’t let the virus rip and so we have followed since June a balanced approach with the support of many Members across the House to keeping the R down while keeping schools and the economy going and controlling the virus by changing our behaviour so as to restrict its spread That is why we have the Rule of Six, and why we have restrictions such as a 10pm closing time on our hospitality sector. Mr Speaker, I take no pleasure whatsoever in imposing restrictions on these businesses, many of which have gone to great lengths to reopen as safely as possible. Nor do I want to stop people enjoying themselves, but we must act to save lives. And the evidence shows that in changing our behaviour in restricting transmission between us our actions are saving lives. Left unchecked each person with the virus will infect on average between 2.7 and 3 others but SAGE assess that the current R nationally is between 1.2 and 1.5. So we are already suppressing that R to well below its natural level which is why the virus is not spreading as quickly as it did in March. But we need to go further. In recent months, we have worked with local leaders to counter local spikes with targeted restrictions. But this local approach has inevitably produced different sets of rules in different parts of the country that are now complex to understand and enforce. So just as we simplified our national rules with the Rule of Six, we will now simplify and standardise our local rules by introducing a three tiered system of local Covid Alert Levels in England - set at medium, high, and very high. The “medium” alert level, which will cover most of the country, and will consist of the current national measures. This includes the Rule of Six and the closure of hospitality at 10pm. The “high” alert level reflects the interventions in many local areas at the moment. This primarily aims to reduce household to household transmission, by preventing all mixing between different households or support bubbles indoors. In these areas, the Rule of Six will continue to apply outdoors, where it is harder for the virus to spread, in public spaces as well as private gardens. Most areas which are already subject to local restrictions will automatically move into the “high” alert level. As a result of rising infection rates, Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak will also move into the “high” alert level. The “very high” alert level will apply where transmission rates are rising most rapidly and where the NHS could soon be under unbearable pressure without further restrictions. In these areas the government will set a baseline of prohibiting social mixing indoors and in private gardens and, I’m sorry to say, closing pubs and bars, We want to create the maximum possible local consensus behind this more severe local action, so in each area, we will work with local government leaders on the additional measures which should be taken. This could lead to further restrictions on the hospitality, leisure, entertainment or personal care sectors. But retail, schools and universities will remain open. As my Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor has set out, the government will expand its unprecedented economic support to assist those affected by these decisions, extending our Job Support Scheme to cover two-thirds of the wages of those in any business that is required to close, and providing those businesses with a cash grant of up to £3,000 a month, instead of £1500 every three weeks. We will also provide Local Authorities across England with around £1 billion of new financial support, on top of our £3.6 billion Towns Fund. And for very high areas, we will give further financial support for local test and trace, and local enforcement and assistance from the armed forces – not for enforcement but rather to support local services, if desired in the local area. Mr Speaker, I can report that we have been able to reach agreement with leaders in Merseyside. Local Authorities in the Liverpool City Region will move into the “very high” alert level from Wednesday. In addition to the baseline I have outlined, that is as well as pubs and bars, in Merseyside gyms and leisure centres, betting shops, adult gaming centres and casinos will also close. I would like to put on record my thanks to Steve Rotheram and his colleagues for their cooperation in very difficult circumstances. Engagement with other leaders in the North West, the North East and Yorkshire &amp; Humber is continuing. I know how difficult this is – they like, like everyone in the House, us are grappling with very real dilemmas - but we cannot let the NHS fall over when lives are at stake. So let me repeat the offer that we are making to those local authorities – work with us on these difficult but necessary measures in the areas that are rated very high areas, in return for: 
more support for local test and trace
more funding for local enforcement
the offer of help from the armed services
the job support scheme as announced by the Chancellor

I believe not to act would be unforgivable, so I hope that rapid progress can be made in the coming days. Regulations for all three Covid local alert levels are being laid today. They will be debated and voted on tomorrow, before coming into force on Wednesday. We will also keep these measures under constant review, including a four-week sunset clause for interventions in “very high” areas. A postcode search on gov.uk, as well as the NHS Covid-19 app, will show which local alert level applies in each area and we are also publishing updated guidance to explain what the Covid alert levels mean for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. And while these levels specifically apply to England, we continue work closely with the Devolved Administrations to tackle this virus across the whole of United Kingdom. Mr Speaker This is not how we want to live our lives, but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human and indeed economic cost of an uncontained epidemic With local and regional and national government coming together in a shared responsibility and a shared effort to deliver ever better testing and tracing, ever more efficient enforcement of the rules and with ever improving therapies, with the mountains of PPE and the ventilators that we have stockpiled With all the lessons we have learned in the last few months we are becoming better and better at fighting this virus and though I must warn the House again that the weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed And I commend this statement to the House 

Boris:


From the tiniest of plants to the mightiest, most majestic megafauna, the natural life that so enriches our planet today is declining at a pace that is truly terrifying. Almost 70 per cent of the world’s wildlife has been lost in the past half century – a lifetime to many of us but the blink of an eye in the grand sweep of planetary evolution. As many as one million species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction. We are on the brink of a world in which the orang-utan and the black rhino can be found not in the jungles of Borneo or the savannahs of Africa, but confined to the  pages of a history book. And consider the pangolin – that scaly mammalian miracle of evolution boasting a prehensile tongue that is somehow attached to its pelvis. I don’t believe any of us would choose to bequeath a planet on which such a wonderfully bizarre little creature is as unfamiliar to future generations as dinosaurs and dodos are to us today. Yet that is what awaits us if we continue down this road. And that’s not just bad news for the pangolins, though it is a tragedy – it is bad news for all of us. Upset the delicate balance nature has achieved over tens of millions of years and the consequences could be catastrophic – for the economy, for the climate, for food security, for public health, for all the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet alongside the growing evidence of looming disaster I see growing evidence of a desire to avert it. There is the very fact of this summit, the first of its kind. The Leaders’ Pledge for Nature has been signed by the heads of many nations, including, I am proud to say, myself. And that’s not all the UK has been doing. At home we’re putting biodiversity targets into law; removing deforestation from our own supply chains; shifting our land use subsidies to support rather than damage nature. Internationally, we spearheaded the ambitious Global Ocean Alliance, committed to protecting at least 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030. We’ve doubled our funding for International Climate Finance. We are launching a £500 million Blue Planet Fund to protect and restore marine ecosystems, and our Blue Belt programme is on track to protect marine areas the size of India. And of course as co-host of COP26 and president of next year’s G7 we are going to make sure the natural world stays right at the top of the global agenda. Because the rhinos and the pangolins and all the other threatened species and everyone who relies on that diversity of life, they need more than good intentions. They need concerted, co-ordinated, global action. Let this be the day that action begins. And let us leave the next generation a world every bit as diverse and wondrous as the one we inherited. 

Boris:


When I spoke to you all last week I explained that the number of Covid patients going into hospital had doubled in a fortnight and I explained that the rate of infections was climbing steeply. I said that we faced the sad reality that on these figures we could expect many more daily deaths. And so that’s why we announced the package of restrictions and stronger enforcement last week. At the same time we’ve been intensifying the local lockdowns in areas where the disease has been flaring up. I want to say - I know how tough it is and has been for these communities and I want to pay a particular tribute to the students who are experiencing a first term back at university unlike anything they could have imagined. I can assure you, assure everybody at university, that plans are being put in place to allow students home safely for Christmas. I wish I could tell you tonight that the impact of this package has already begun to appear but it will take time to feed through. And yesterday we saw the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began, today a further 7,108. We’ve also had a tragic increase in the number of daily deaths – with 71 yesterday and again today. And these figures show why our plan is so essential We now have to stick to it together - and we should stick to it with confidence, because there are many ways in which we are far better prepared than we were in March. We are on track to hit our target of being able to conduct 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, We’re already exceeding the number of tests per capita that are conducted in Germany, France and Spain. We have over 2,000 beds that could be available across seven Nightingale hospitals, and we will be able to go further if needed. We’ve ordered 32 billion items of PPE, and we’ll have a four month stockpile of masks, visors, gowns and other essentials for winter. By December, by the way, we expect UK manufacturers will meet 70 per cent of the demand for PPE compared with just one per cent before the pandemic. And in the last six months we have more than trebled the availability of mechanical ventilators to our NHS across the UK to 31,500. But the best way forwards, to protect the NHS, save lives, to keep our children in school and the economy moving, is to follow the rules wherever we live. So I want to thank everyone for the fantastic national effort that we are seeing, continuing to see And no matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become there is only one way of doing this, and that’s by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others. At this critical moment, when I know people will be wanting to know the details, I will be providing regular updates through these press conferences. And I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now But if we put in the work together now, then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say, I profoundly disagree. And I don’t think it’s what the British people want, I don’t think they want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do. Even as we fight Covid, it is vital that people get all the treatment they need for other conditions. But I must be clear, if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by covid, then no-one could get any such care. That’s why we must bear down on the virus now, so that we never reach that point, and I am absolutely confident that with ever increased testing, with better treatments and of course with the prospect of a vaccine, we will get through this. So let’s follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing, download the app, as 14 million of you have already done, and together we will fight back against this virus, protect our NHS and save many more lives. 

Boris:


There are many reasons to – for me I should say – to come here to Exeter College – the outstanding Further Education College in Devon. You have a total of 462 courses – some which I tried this morning – from particle physics to cake decorating. And you offer your students an extraordinary chance to skill themselves in everything from football coaching to specialist Devon cookery, industrial robotics, heavy vehicle manufacture and design. And I am thrilled that you offer philosophy, and languages, and even classical civilisation – but this is the home of the practical, the hands-on, disciplines that are not only academically and intellectually challenging but which are also of immediate practical usefulness and relevance to the world we live in. And I don’t just mean useful for individual jobs and livelihoods. All of us in this country need you to have those practical skills – we need those practical skills collectively, as a society and as an economy - more than ever. And so today I want to set out how this government will offer a Lifetime Skills Guarantee to help people train and retrain– at any stage in their lives – and enable us not just to come through this crisis, but to come back stronger, and build back better. Our economy has been shaken by COVID, and in the hand-to-mouth scrabblings of the pandemic the shortcomings of our labour market – and our educational system – have been painfully apparent. In the last few months I have been touring labs where people, many of them young, are working flat out on testing samples – testing for the disease, testing for the efficacy of potential vaccines, testing the tests. And it is hard work. It requires endless patience, and good hand-eye coordination. It also requires an excellent grounding in lab techniques and in the science – and every time I have been fascinated to find that a sizeable proportion of the technicians are from overseas. And though I welcome that, because it is one of the glories of our education system that it attracts so many people from around the world, we have to face the fact – that at this moment when we need them so much, there is a shortage of UK-trained lab technicians, just as there is a shortage of so many crucial skills. We are short of skilled construction workers, and skilled mechanics, and skilled engineers, and we are short of hundreds of thousands of IT experts. And it is not as though the market does not require these skills. The market will pay richly. The problem is one of supply – and somehow our post-18 educational system is not working in such a way as to endow people with those skills. And look I don’t for a second want to blame our universities. I love our universities, and it is one of this country’s great achievements massively to have expanded higher education. But we also need to recognise that a significant and growing minority of young people leave university and work in a non-graduate job, and end up wondering whether they did the right thing. Was it sensible to rack up that debt on that degree? Were they ever given the choice to look at the more practical options, the courses – just as stimulating - that lead more directly to well-paid jobs? We seem on the one hand to have too few of the right skills for the jobs our economy creates, and on the other hand too many graduates with degrees which don’t get them the jobs that they want. And the truth is we’re not giving anywhere near enough of the right kind of training or support to the fifty per cent of young people who don’t want to go to university, and so we’re depriving them of the chance to find their vocation and develop a fulfilling, well-paid career. And so the result is business isn’t happy; the economy is under-productive; and many working adults are stuck in jobs without much future when they are hungry for new opportunities. So it is time for change, and for radical change. Let us begin by admitting that part of the problem is that not every FE college is as superb as Exeter College. We need to invest in skills, and we need to invest in FE. That is why we are putting £1.5 billion into upgrading and improving colleges across the country, fixing the leaky ceilings, bringing forward £200 million this year. The facilities here are awesome. I tried them myself this morning. And improving all FE is part of our levelling up agenda to ensure that the same quality applies everywhere. And as everybody knows, you can’t acquire skills in the classroom alone. You need to learn on the job, to build up the muscle memory and not just the theoretical understanding. So I can announce today that we will be expanding apprenticeships, reforming the system so that unspent funds can be used more easily to support apprenticeships not just in big companies, but in the SMEs where there is so much potential for job creation. And we want many more of these apprenticeships to be portable – so you can take them from company to company. Suppose you are in a small start-up making videos for Youtube, and the project ends – so you’ve got to move to another such small company. Under our plans, you will be able to take that apprenticeship to your new employer and it won’t die with the end of the contract. But if we are going to reform our post-18 education, we must go much further. We’ve got to end the pointless, nonsensical gulf that has been fixed for generations – more than 100 years – between the so-called academic and the so-called practical varieties of education. It’s absurd to talk about skills in this limited way. Everything is ultimately a skill – a way of doing something faster, better, more efficiently, more accurately, more confidently, whether it is carving, or painting, or brick laying, or writing, or drawing, or mathematics, Greek philosophy; every single study can be improved not just by practice but by teaching. So now is the time to end this bogus distinction between FE and HE. We are going to change the funding model so that it is just as easy to get a student loan to do a year of electrical engineering at an FE college – or do two years of electrical engineering – as it is to get a loan to do a three year degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. The Augar review highlighted the complexity of the funding system, the bias that propels young people into universities and away from technical education. It is time to end that bias. We will give FE colleges access to the main student finance system, so that they are better able to compete with universities; not for every FE course, but for a specific list of valuable and mainly technical courses to be agreed with employers. And in the coming years, as part of our Lifetime Skills Guarantee, we will move to a system where every student will have a flexible lifelong loan entitlement to four years of post-18 education – and suddenly, with that four year entitlement, and with the same funding mechanism, you bring universities and FE closer together; you level up between them, and a new vista of choice opens up. I want every student with the aptitude and the desire to go to university to get the support they need, but I also want all young people to be given a real choice in life, and not to feel there is only one route to success. At the moment many young people feel they have to go for the degree option. They feel they have only one chance to study, and to borrow. They might as well go for the maximum, and get a degree. Under our plans you could go for a one-year technical qualification and launch yourself at life – or you could do that, and then go to university later on. You have the choice. And it will be easier for older people to borrow to do courses locally - and to study and train part-time – to acquire the skills that can transform their lives. And of course we need this nimbleness now, this flexibility to acquire new skills, because COVID has massively accelerated changes that were already happening in the UK economy, whether in retail or in restaurant chains. And while the government is building on our furlough scheme, And we’re devising ever more imaginative ways to safeguard jobs and livelihoods, including the Winter Economy Plan, which Rishi Sunak the Chancellor announced last week, Alas as Rishi said, we cannot save every job. But what we can do is give everybody, give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs. Of the workforce in 2030, ten years from now, the vast majority are already in jobs right now. But a huge number of them are going to have to change jobs – to change skills – and at the moment, if you’re over 23, the state provides virtually no free training to help you. In fact we have seen a haemorrhage, in the last 20 years, in adult education – a million fewer than there were. We are going to change that right now. We are expanding the digital boot camps – where you can learn IT, whatever your age, replicating our highly successful training camps in Manchester and Birmingham in four more locations. Above all, from next April, we will introduce a new funding promise.  As part of our Lifetime Skills Guarantee, we will now fund technical courses for adults equivalent to A level, all of which teach skills that are highly in demand. They’ll give anyone who left school without an A-Level, or equivalent, the qualifications they need when they need them, when they need them, helping people to change jobs and find work in the burgeoning new sectors that this country is creating. So suppose you work in retail or hospitality, and you think you are going to need to find a new job. And before COVID people were already shopping more online, and already sending out for food. But the crisis has compressed that revolution. So let’s imagine that you are 30 years old, and you left school without A levels, and you are thinking you could find a job – you were in retail or hospitality – you could find a job in the wind farm sector in the north east, or in space technology in Newquay, or in construction here in Exeter, or retrofitting homes so as to reduce carbon. You might see a job for yourself on one of the vast engineering and infrastructure projects that this government is leading: a surveyor or a rail technician. You might want to work in adult care. Crucial sector for our country. You have a huge range of options – in theory – but you need that technical knowhow, you need that A-level equivalent qualification; and we will fund it. We will give you the skills you need. The British economy is in the process of huge and rapid change, driven by the internet and the possibilities of remote communication. But as old types of employment fall away, new opportunities are opening up with dizzying speed – vast new sectors in which this country already leads or can lead the world. And over the last few centuries there is no other country that has shown the same adaptability, the same ingenuity in matching the demands of new technology. But for the last few decades, alas, we have been hamstrung as a country by a lack of investment in infrastructure, in science, by our antiquated planning system and by our failures in technical education. And this Government is putting that right We’re making unprecedented investments in infrastructure - and doubling the investment in science and technology from £11 billion to £22 billion a year by 2024. We’re changing the planning rules so that it’s easier to provide homes for young families and for businesses to grow and invest. And we’re transforming the foundations of the skills system so everyone has the chance to train and retrain. And this combination of reforms will tackle the fundamental problems in our economy of productivity and growth helping the country to invent new industries and contribute to humanity’s great challenges, from fighting pandemics to achieving net zero carbon emissions. Above all, it will make this country, our United Kingdom richer and it will make our country fairer. So my message today is that at every stage in your life, this government will help you get the skills you need. Through our Lifetime Skills Guarantee, we’ll upgrade Further Education colleges across the country with huge capital investment; we’ll expand apprenticeships, making it easier to get a high quality apprenticeship, and connect them better to local employers who know where the jobs of the future are going to emerge; we’ll fund free technical courses for adults equivalent to A level, and extend our digital boot camps; we’ll expand and transform the funding system so it’s as easy to get a loan for a higher technical course as for a university degree, and we’ll enable FE colleges to access funding on the same terms as our most famous universities; and we’ll give everyone a flexible lifelong loan entitlement to four years of post-18 education — so adults will be able to retrain with high level technical courses, instead of being trapped in unemployment. And this long-term plan – learning from what has worked around the world – will finally enable our amazing country to close the gap with other countries that in this one respect have had – or thought they had – the edge on us when it comes to skills and technical education. They thought they had the edge on us for 100 years. Well we have the talent. We have the potential. All we need to do is give people the chance. And yes we face a once a century pandemic but now is the time to fix a problem that has plagued this country for decades. Now is the time to end the pointless, snooty, and frankly vacuous distinction between the practical and the academic. And now is the time to give everybody – with this Lifetime Skills Guarantee – give people of all ages the means and the confidence to switch and get the skills they need. And now is the time for all of us to begin to build back better. 

Boris:


Watch the Prime Minister’s speech Never in the history of our species – not since the Almighty felled the Tower of Babel – has the human race been so obsessed with one single topic of conversation. We have been following the same debates, researching the potential of the same drugs, and time and again we have been typing the same word into our search engines. COVID-19, coronavirus, has united humanity as never before. And yet the crisis has also been an extraordinary force for division. We have all been up against the same enemy. The same tiny opponent threatening everyone in much the same way, but members of the UN have still waged 193 separate campaigns, as if every country somehow contains a different species of human being. Across the world there has been an infinite variety of curfews and restrictions and closures, and we have fought in a spirit of sauve qui peut. And the pace has been so urgent and the pressures so intense that each national government – democracy or otherwise – has decided entirely understandably to put the interests of its domestic population first. We have seen borders spring up between friends and allies, sometimes without consultation. We have seen the disruption of global supply chains with cheque book wars on airport tarmacs as nation has vied with nation for a supply of PPE. And after 9 months of fighting COVID-19, the very notion of the international community looks, frankly, pretty tattered. And we know that we simply can’t continue in this way. Unless we get our act together. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. The inevitable outcome would be to prolong this calamity and increase the risk of another. Now is the time – therefore, here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA –  for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts. Let’s heal the world – literally and metaphorically. And let’s begin with the truth, because as someone once said, the truth shall set you free. And with nearly a million people dead, with colossal economic suffering already inflicted and more to come, there is a moral imperative for humanity to be honest and to reach a joint understanding of how the pandemic began, and how it was able to spread – Not because I want to blame any country or government, or to score points. I simply believe – as a former COVID patient – that we all have a right to know, so that we can collectively do our best to prevent a recurrence. And so the UK supports the efforts of the World Health Organisation and of my friend, Tedros, to explore the aetiology of the disease, because however great the need for reform, the WHO, the World Health Organization, is still the one body that marshals humanity against the legions of disease. That is why we in the UK – global Britain – are one of the biggest global funders of that organisation, contributing £340 million over the next 4 years, that’s an increase of 30%. And as we now send our medical detectives to interview the witnesses and the suspects – bats, the pangolins, whoever – we should have enough humility to acknowledge that alarm bells were ringing before this calamity struck. In the last 20 years, there have been 8 outbreaks of a lethal virus, any of which could have escalated into a pandemic. Bill Gates sounded the alert in 2015, 5 years ago he gave that amazing prediction – almost every word of which has come true – and we responded as if to a persistent Microsoft error message by clicking ‘ok’ and carrying on. Humanity was caught napping. We have been scrabbling to catch up, and with agonising slowness we are making progress. Epidemiologists at Oxford University identified the first treatment for COVID-19. They did trials with our national health service and found that a cheap medicine called dexamethasone reduces the risk of death by over a third for patients on ventilators. The UK immediately shared this discovery with the world, so that as many as 1.4 million lives could be saved in the next six months by this one, single advance. And as I speak there are 100 potential vaccines that are trying to clear the hurdles of safety and efficacy, as if in a giant global steeplechase. We don’t know which may be successful. We do not know if any of them will be successful. The Oxford vaccine is now in stage 3 of clinical trials, and in case of success AstraZeneca has already begun to manufacture millions of doses, in readiness for rapid distribution,  and they have reached agreement with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses to low and middle-income countries. But it would be futile to treat the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage and immoral to seek a head start through obtaining research by underhand means. The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and, the UK, we will do everything in our power to bring this about. We are already the biggest single donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness to find a vaccine. And it is precisely because we know that no-one is safe until everyone is safe, that I can announce that the UK will contribute up to £571 million to COVAX, a new initiative designed to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine across the world. Of this sum, £500 million will be for developing countries to protect themselves. The UK is already the biggest donor to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In June we helped to raise almost $9 billion to immunise another 300 million children against killer diseases, and Gavi also stands ready to help distribute a COVID-19 vaccine. But even as we strive for a vaccine, we must never cut corners, slim down the trials or sacrifice safety to speed. Because it would be an absolute tragedy if in our eagerness, we were to boost the nutjobs – the anti vaxxers, dangerous obsessives who campaign against the whole concept of vaccination and who would risk further millions of lives. And now is the time above all to look ahead and think now about how to stop a pandemic from happening again. How can we stop another virus from coming along and again smashing that precious Ming vase of international cooperation?  How can we avoid the mutual quarantines and the brutal Balkanisation of the world economy? I don’t think there is any reason for fatalism: of course, the dangers can never be wholly eliminated, but human ingenuity and expertise can reduce the risk.  Imagine how much suffering might have been avoided if we had already identified the pathogen that became COVID-19 while it was still confined to animals? Suppose we had been able to reach immediately into a global medicine chest and take out a treatment? What if countries had been ready to join together from the outset to develop and trial a vaccine? And think how much strife would have been prevented if the necessary protocols – covering quarantine and data-sharing and PPE and so much else – had, so far as possible, been ready on the shelf for humanity to use? So we in the UK we’re going to work with our friends, we’re going to use our G7 presidency next year to create a new global approach to health security based on a 5-point plan to protect humanity against another pandemic. Our first aim should be to stop a new disease before it starts. About 60% of the pathogens circulating in the human population originated in animals and leapt from one species to the other in a ‘zoonotic’ transmission. The world could seek to minimise the danger by forging a global network of zoonotic research hubs, charged with spotting dangerous animal pathogens that may cross the species barrier and infect human beings. The UK is ready to harness its scientific expertise and cooperate to the fullest extent with our global partners to this end. Of the billions of pathogens, the great mass are thankfully incapable of vaulting the species barrier. Once we discover the dangerous ones, our scientists could get to work on identifying their weaknesses and refining anti-viral treatments before they strike. We could open the research to every country and as we learn more, our scientists might begin to assemble an armoury of therapies – a global pharmacopoeia – ready to make the treatment for the next COVID-19. Our second step should be to develop the manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines So that the whole of humanity can hold them like missiles in silos ready to zap the alien organisms before they can attack. But if that fails and a new disease jumps from animals to human beings and overcomes our armoury of therapies and begins to spread, then we need to know what’s going on as fast as possible. So the third objective should be to design a global pandemic early warning system, based on a vast expansion of our ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings, using health data-sharing agreements covering every country. As far as possible, we should aim to predict a pandemic almost as we forecast the weather to see the thunderstorm in the cloud no bigger than a man’s hand. And if all our defences are breached, and we face another crisis, we should at least be able to rely on our fourth step, and have all the protocols ready for an emergency response, covering every relevant issue, along with the ability to devise new ones swiftly. Never again must we wage 193 different campaigns against the same enemy. As with all crises, it is crucial not to learn the wrong lessons. After the harrowing struggle to equip ourselves with enough ventilators – with countries scrabbling to improvise like the marooned astronauts of Apollo 13 – there is a global movement to onshore manufacturing. That is understandable. Here in the UK we found ourselves unable to make gloves, aprons, enzymes which an extraordinary position for a country that was once the workshop of the world. We need to rediscover that latent gift and instinct, but it would be insane to ignore the insights of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. We need secure supply chains – but we should still rely on the laws of comparative advantage and the invisible hand of the market.  Many countries imposed export controls at the outset of the pandemic, about two thirds of which remain in force. Governments still target their trade barriers on exactly what we most need to combat the virus, with tariffs on disinfectant often exceeding 10%, and for soap tariffs for 30%. So I would urge every country to take a fifth step and lift the export controls wherever possible – and agree not to revive them – and cancel any tariffs on the vital tools of our struggle: gloves, protective equipment, thermometers and other COVID-critical products. The UK will do this as soon as our new independent tariff regime comes into effect on 1st January and I hope others will do the same. Though the world is still in the throes of this pandemic, all these steps are possible if we have the will. They are the right way forward for the world, and Britain is the right country to give that lead. And we will do so in 2021, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this great United Nations in London in January, and through our G7 Presidency, and as we host the world’s climate change summit, COP26, in Glasgow next November. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an immense psychic shock to the human race. Global fears have been intensified by the immediacy of round the clock news and social media. We sometimes forget, we face a virus – a small package of nucleic acid that simply replicates. It is not even technically alive. Tragic as its consequences have been, it has been nothing like as destructive as other plagues – let alone the influenza of a century ago. It is absurd, in many ways, outrageous that this microscopic enemy should have routed the unity of the human race. COVID-19 has caused us to cease other vital work, and I’m afraid it made individual nations seem selfish and divided from each other. Every day people were openly encouraged to study a grisly reverse Olympic league table, and to take morbid and totally mistaken comfort in the greater sufferings of others. We cannot go on like that, we cannot make these mistakes again. And here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world’s first vaccine We are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN, to heal those divisions and to heal the world. 

Boris:


PM address the nation on coronavirus 22 September Good evening, the struggle against covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere. Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families. And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win – and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face – none of them easy – and why we must take action now. I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before. When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay. But we have to acknowledge this this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches – too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing. We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time; and I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves – the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress covid now. So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England – early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply; and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors – a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach – robust but proportionate – already carries the support of all the main parties in parliament. After discussion with colleagues in the Devolved Administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. And to those who say we don’t need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own. The tragic reality of having covid is that your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell. And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable – with all the suffering that would entail – I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers. That’s why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to £10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary. And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone’s freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring. If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space – once again – to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-covid medical needs. And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don’t follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus. That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before. We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines – pioneered in this country – that can help save lives. And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon – and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That’s the hope; that’s the dream. It’s hard, but it’s attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there. But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour. If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will make a statement on our response to the rising number of Coronavirus cases and how we must act now to avoid still graver consequences later on. At every stage in this pandemic we have struck a delicate balance between saving lives by protecting our NHS and minimising the wider impact of our restrictions. And it is because of the common sense and fortitude of the British people that earlier this year we were able to avert an even worse catastrophe, forming a human shield around our NHS, and then by getting our country moving again by reopening key sectors of our economy and returning children to school. But we always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. And I am sorry to say that - as in Spain and France and many other countries - we have reached a perilous turning point. A month ago, on average around a thousand people across the UK were testing positive for Coronavirus every day. The latest figure has almost quadrupled to 3,929. Yesterday the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser warned that the doubling rate for new cases could be between seven and 20 days with the possibility of tens of thousands of new infections next month. I wish I could reassure the House that the growing number of cases is merely a function of more testing, but a rising proportion of the tests themselves are yielding a positive result. I also wish I could say that more of our people now have the antibodies to keep the virus off, but the latest data suggest that fewer than 8 per cent of us are in this position. It is true that the number of new cases is growing fastest amongst those aged 20-29, but the evidence shows that the virus is spreading to other more vulnerable age groups, as we have seen in France and Spain where this has led to increased hospital admissions and, sadly, more deaths. In the last fortnight, daily hospital admissions in England have more than doubled. Tens of thousands of daily infections in October would, as night follows day, lead to hundreds of daily deaths in November and those numbers would continue to grow unless we act. And as with all respiratory viruses, Covid is likely to spread faster as autumn becomes winter. Yesterday, on the advice of the four Chief Medical Officers, the UK’s Covid alert level was raised from 3 to 4, the second most serious stage, meaning that transmission is high or rising exponentially. So this is the moment when we must act. If we can curb the number of daily infections, and reduce the Reproduction rate to 1, then we can save lives, protect the NHS, and the most vulnerable, and shelter the economy from the far sterner and more costly measures that would inevitably become necessary later. So we are acting on the principle that a stitch in time saves nine. The Government will introduce new restrictions in England, carefully judged to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number with the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods. I want to stress that this is by no means a return to the full lockdown of March. We are not issuing a general instruction to stay at home. We will ensure that schools, colleges and universities stay open - because nothing is more important than the education, health and well-being of our young people. We will ensure that businesses can stay open in a Covid-compliant way. However, we must take action to suppress the disease. First, we are once again asking office workers who can work from home to do so. In key public services – and in all professions where homeworking is not possible, such as construction or retail – people should continue to attend their workplaces. And like Government, this House will be free to take forward its business in a Covid-secure way which you, Mr Speaker, have pioneered. Second, from Thursday all pubs, bars and restaurants must operate table-service only, Mr Speaker, except for takeaways. Together with all hospitality venues, they must close at 10pm. To help the police to enforce this rule, I am afraid that means alas closing, and not just calling for last orders. Simplicity is paramount. The same will apply to takeaways - though deliveries can continue thereafter. I am sorry this will hurt many businesses just getting back on their feet, but we must act to stop the virus from being transmitted in bars and restaurants. Third, we will extend the requirement to wear face coverings to include staff in retail, all users of taxis and private hire vehicles, and staff and customers in indoor hospitality, except when seated at a table to eat or drink. Fourth, in retail, leisure, tourism and other sectors, our Covid-secure guidelines will become legal obligations. Businesses will be fined and could be closed if they breach these rules. Fifth, now is the time to tighten up the rule of six. I’m afraid that from Monday, a maximum of 15 people will be able to attend wedding ceremonies and receptions. Though, up to 30 can still attend a funeral as now. We will also have to extend the rule of six to all adult indoor team sports. Finally, we have to acknowledge that the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen business conferences, exhibitions and large sporting events so we will not be able to do this from 1 October. And I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities, and my RH Friends the Chancellor and Culture Secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them. Mr Speaker, these rules measures will only work if people comply. There is nothing more frustrating for the vast majority, the law-abiding majority that do comply than the sight of a few brazenly defying the rules. So these rules will be enforced by tighter penalties. We have already introduced a fine of up to £10,000 for those who fail to self-isolate and such fines will now be applied to businesses breaking Covid rules. The penalty for failing to wear a mask or breaking the rule of six will now double to £200 for a first offence. We will provide the police and local authorities with the extra funding they need, a greater police presence on our streets, and the option to draw on military support where required to free up the police. The measures I have announced all apply in England and the Devolved Administrations are taking similar steps. I spoke yesterday with each of the First Ministers and again today and I thank them for their collaboration: the health of everyone in these islands depends on our common success. Already about 13 million people across England are living under various local restrictions, over and above national measures. We will continue to act against local flare-ups, working alongside councils and strengthening measures where necessary.
And I want to speak directly to those who were shielding early in the pandemic and may be anxious about being at greater risk.
Following advice from our senior clinicians, our guidance continues to be that you do not need to shield – except in local lockdown areas – and we will keep this under constant review.
I must emphasise that if all our actions fail to bring the R below 1, then we reserve the right to deploy greater firepower, with significantly greater restrictions. I fervently want to avoid taking this step, as do the Devolved Administrations, but we will only be able to avoid it if our new measures work and our behaviour changes. Mr Speaker, we will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments and new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress, we should assume that the restrictions I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months. For the time being, this virus is a fact of our lives and I must tell the House and the country that our fight against it will continue. We will not listen to those who say let the virus rip; nor to those who urge a permanent lockdown; we are taking decisive and appropriate steps to balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods. I know all of this will have profound consequences for our constituents, so the government will give the House every opportunity to scrutinise our decisions. In addition to regular statements and debates, Hon Members will be able to question the government’s scientific advisers more regularly, gain access to data about their constituencies, your constituencies and join daily calls with my RH Friend the Paymaster General. After six months of restrictions, it would be tempting to hope that the threat has faded, and seek comfort in the belief that if you have avoided the virus so far then you are somehow immune. I have to say that it is that kind of complacency that could be our undoing. If we fail to act together now we will not only place others at risk but jeopardise our own futures with the more drastic action that we would inevitably be forced to take. Mr Speaker, no British government would wish to stifle our freedoms in the ways that we have found necessary this year. Yet even now we can draw some comfort from the fact that schools and universities and places of worship are staying open, shops can serve their customers, construction workers can go to building sites, and the vast majority of the UK economy can continue moving forwards. We are also, Mr Speaker, better prepared for a second wave, with the ventilators, the PPE, the dexamethasone, the Nightingale Hospitals, and a hundred times as much testing. So now it falls to each of us and every one of us to remember the basics – wash our hands, cover our faces, observe social distancing – and follow the rules. Then we can fight back against this virus, shelter our economy from even greater damage, protect the most vulnerable in care homes and hospitals, safeguard our NHS and save many more lives. And I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time and this House acts to preserve one of the crucial British achievements of the last three centuries: namely our ability to trade freely across the whole of these islands. The creation of our United Kingdom that has stood for centuries by the Acts of Union of 1707 and 1801 was not simply a political event but an act of conscious economic integration that laid the foundations of the world’s first industrial revolution and the prosperity we enjoy today. When other countries in Europe stayed divided, we joined our fortunes together and allowed the invisible hand of the market to move Cornish pasties to Scotland Scottish Beef to Wales Welsh beef to England and Devonshire Clotted Cream to Northern Ireland or wherever else it might be enjoyed. And when we chose to join the EU back in 1973, we also thereby decided that the EU treaties should serve as the legal guarantor of these freedoms. Now that we have left the EU, and the transition period is about to elapse, we need the armature of our law once again to preserve the arrangements on which so many jobs and livelihoods depend. That is the fundamental purpose of this Bill, which should be welcomed by everyone who cares about the sovereignty and integrity of our United Kingdom. We shall provide the legal certainty relied upon by every business in our country including, of course, in Northern Ireland. The manifesto on which this Government was elected last year promised business in Northern Ireland – and I quote - “unfettered access to the rest of the UK” adding that we would – and I quote – “maintain and strengthen the integrity and smooth operation of our internal market.” This Bill is designed to honour that pledge and maintain those freedoms. When we renegotiated our Withdrawal Agreement from the EU we struck a careful balance to reflect Northern Ireland’s integral place in our United Kingdom while preserving an open border with Ireland with the express and paramount aim of protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement and the peace process. In good faith we accepted certain obligations in the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to give our European friends the assurances they sought on the integrity of their single market while avoiding any change to the border on the island of Ireland. We agreed to conduct some light touch processes on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in case they were transferred to the EU and we are conducting those checks in accordance with our obligations, creating the sanitary and phytosanitary processes required under the Protocol, and spending hundreds of millions of pounds on helping traders. Under this finely balanced arrangement our EU friends agreed that Northern Ireland would remain part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom, able to benefit from the free trade deals with other countries which we are now beginning to strike and ensuring that goods not “at risk” of travelling to the EU – and that is the majority of goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - do not have to pay tariffs. But the details of these intricate arrangements and the obvious tensions about provisions can only be resolved with a basic minimum of common sense and goodwill from all sides. I regret to have to tell the House that in recent months the EU has suggested that it is ready to go to extreme and unreasonable lengths using the Northern Ireland Protocol in a way that goes well beyond common sense, simply to exert leverage against the UK in our negotiations for a free trade agreement. To take the most glaring example, the EU has said that if we fail to reach an agreement to their satisfaction they might very well refuse to list the UK’s food and agricultural products for sale anywhere in the EU And it gets even worse. Because under the Protocol this creates an instant and automatic prohibition of the transfer of our animal products from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Speaker, are interlocutors on the other side are holding out the possibility of blockading food and agricultural transports within our own country. Absurd and self-defeating as that action would be even as we debate this matter, the EU still have not taken this revolver off the table. I still hope that they will do so And that we can reach a Canada-style free trade agreement as well Indeed it is such an extraordinary threat – and it seems so incredible that the EU could do this – that we are not taking the powers in this bill to neutralise that threat but obviously reserve the right to do so if these threats persist.  Because I am afraid these threats reveal the spirit in which some of our friends are currently minded to conduct these negotiations. It goes to what my learned friends would call the intentions of some of those involved in these talks. As things stands, there are other avenues – in addition to the blockade on agricultural goods - that the EU could explore if they are determined to interpret the Protocol in absurd ways and if they fail to negotiate in good faith, we must now take a package of protective powers in this Bill and subsequently. For example there is the question of tariffs in the Irish Sea. When we signed the Protocol we accepted that goods “at risk” of going from Great Britain into the EU via Northern Ireland should pay the EU’s tariff as they cross the Irish Sea, but any goods staying within Northern Ireland would not do so. The Protocol created a Joint Committee to identify with the EU which goods were “at risk” of going into Ireland This sensible process was one of the achievements of our agreement and our view is that this forum remains the best way of solving this question. But I’m afraid some in the EU are now relying on legal defaults to argue that every good is “at risk” and therefore liable for tariffs. That would mean Mr Speaker, tariffs that could get as high as 90 per cent by value on Scottish beef Going to Northern Ireland moving not from Stranraer to Dublin but from Stranraer to Belfast, within our United Kingdom. Tariffs potentially over 61 per cent on Welsh lamb heading from Anglesey to Antrim And potentially over 100 per cent on clotted cream moving from Torridge - to pick a Devonshire town at random - to Larne. Mr Speaker, this is unreasonable and clearly against the spirit of that Protocol They are threatening to carve tariff borders across our own country, divide our own land, change the very economic geography of the UK and egregiously ride roughshod over their own commitment under Article 4 of the Protocol, whereby and I quote – “Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom.” Mr Speaker, we cannot have a situation where the very boundaries of our country could be dictated by a foreign power or international organisation. No British Prime Minister, no Government, no Parliament could ever accept such an imposition. Last year we signed the Withdrawal Agreement in the belief the EU would be reasonable. Now, after everything that has recently happened, we must consider the alternative. We ask for reasonableness, and common sense, and for balance and we still hope to achieve that Mr Speaker, through the Joint Committee process in which we always persevere, no matter what the provocation. What we are seeking to do, is to insure this country, to protect this country, against the EU’s proven willingness to use this delicately balanced Protocol in ways for which it was never intended. So this Bill includes our first step to protect our country against such a contingency by creating a legal safety net taking powers in reserve whereby Ministers can act to guarantee the integrity of our United Kingdom. I understand how some people will feel unease over the use of these powers. And I share that sentiment myself and I have absolutely no desire to use these measures. They are an insurance policy and if we reach agreement with our European friends which I still believe is possible - they will never be invoked. And, of course, it is the case that the passing of this Bill does not constitute the exercise of these powers. If they were ever needed, ministers would return to this House with a statutory instrument on which a vote would be held. And we will simultaneously pursue every possible redress under international law, as provided for in the Protocol. In addition to our steps in domestic law, we would if we had to make clear that we believe the EU is engaged in a material breach of its duties of good faith, as required under the Withdrawal Agreement and the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties. We will seek an arbitration, as provided for under the Withdrawal Agreement,
and consider safeguards under Article 16 of the Protocol. It is not a question of if we meet our obligations, but how we fulfil them. We must do so in a way that satisfies the fundamental purpose of the Protocol, the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. We will work with the EU on all of these issues and even if we have to use these powers we will continue to engage with the Joint Committee so that any dispute is resolved as quickly and as amicably as possible, reconciling the integrity of the EU single market with Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom’s customs territory. But what we cannot do now is tolerate a situation where our EU counterparts seriously believe that they have the power to break up our country. That illusion must be decently despatched, and that is why these reserve powers are enshrined in this Bill. In addition, Mr Speaker, this Bill will help deliver the single biggest transfer of powers to the devolved administrations since their creation, covering a total of 160 different policy areas. Each Devolved Administration will also be fully and equally involved in the oversight of the UK’s Internal Market through a new independent body, the Office of the Internal Market. The Bill will maintain our common cause of high standards where we already go beyond the EU in areas ranging from health and safety to consumer and environmental protections. And instead of UK taxpayers’ money being disbursed by the EU it will allow this Government to invest billions of pounds across the whole of the UK to level up Mr Speaker, just a year ago this Parliament was deadlocked, exasperating the British people by its failure to fulfil their democratic wishes and, worst of all, undermining by our negotiators by effectively telling the EU that if they played hardball, this House would oblige them by weakening our country’s hand and legally forbid our representatives from walking away from the negotiating table. Mr Speaker, I hope this House will never make that mistake again Instead, let us seize the opportunity presented by this Bill to send a message of unity and resolve. Let’s say together to our European friends that we want a great future relationship and a fantastic free trade deal but we will not get there if they seek to divide us. With this Bill we will support jobs and growth across the UK. We will back our negotiators in Brussels, And above all, we will protect the territorial integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland So I urge this House to support this Bill and get back to the business of securing a free trade agreement with our closest neighbours that we all wish to see. And Mr Speaker, I commend this Bill to the House. 

Boris:


PM press conference statement 9 September 2020 Good afternoon, Welcome back to Downing Street for an update on coronavirus as we enter autumn and approach winter. I will first hand over to Chris to take us through the latest data before I set out how we are responding to it. Thank you Chris. It is clear from that very powerful graphic that we must act. The most important thing every one of us must do is remember the basics. First, wash your hands, regularly and for 20 seconds. Don’t get back into old habits, it is so vital. Second, wear a face covering over your mouth and nose if you are in an enclosed space and in close contact with people you don’t normally meet. I know wearing a face covering feels odd to some people and I understand that. But face coverings do make it harder for the virus to spread – so please, wear one to protect others. Third, make space. Always stay 2 metres away from people you don’t live with – or 1 metre with extra precautions, like extra ventilation, screens, or face coverings. Fourth, if you have COVID symptoms, get a test and self-isolate. We are now processing 1.2 million tests a week. To date we have carried out 15.4 million antigen tests – that’s more than any other country in Europe, and more per head than other European countries like Germany and Spain. We are increasing our testing capacity further to meet rising demand. You can help by only booking a test if you have a fever, a new continuous cough, or you’ve lost your sense of taste or smell – if you don’t have those symptoms and haven’t been asked to book a test, please don’t. So those are the basics – hands, face, space – and get a test if you have COVID symptoms. Since the pandemic began, we have asked you to reduce your social contact and limit your interactions with friends and family. I know that, over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing. We have spoken to police officers about what they need for an effective enforcement regime and of course, listened to the feedback from you, the public. In response, we are simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce. I should stress that if we are to beat the virus then everyone, at all times, should limit social contact as much as possible and minimise interactions with other households. It is safer to meet outdoors and you should keep your distance from anyone you don’t live with, even if they are close friends or family. So in England, from Monday, we are introducing the rule of 6. You must not meet socially in groups of more than 6 – and if you do, you will be breaking the law. This will apply in any setting, indoors or outdoors, at home or in the pub. The ban will be set out in law and it will be enforced by the police – anyone breaking the rules risks being dispersed, fined and possibly arrested. This single measure replaces both the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors. Now you only need to remember the rule of 6. There will be some limited exemptions. For example, if a single household or support bubble is larger than 6, they can still gather. COVID Secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality venues can still hold more than 6 people in total. Within those venues however, there must not be individual groups larger than 6, and groups must not mix socially or form larger groups. Education and work settings are unaffected, COVID Secure weddings and funerals can go ahead, up to a limit of 30 people, and organised sport will still be able to proceed. As we have found on previous occasions, this rule of 6 will of course throw up difficult cases. For example, two whole households will no longer be able to meet if they would together exceed the limit of 6 people. I am sorry about that and I wish that we did not have to take this step. But, as your Prime Minister, I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and to save lives. We will of course keep the rule of 6 under constant review and only keep it in place as long as it’s necessary. I also want to see – and the public wants to see – stronger enforcement of the rules which are already in place. So I’ve have tasked the Cabinet with increasing enforcement and I would like to thank the police, as always, and other authorities for the work they are doing to keep us all safe. In future: 
Premises and venues where people meet socially will be legally required to request the contact details of a member of every party, record and retain these details for 21 days, and provide them to NHS Test &amp; Trace without delay when required.
We will support local authorities to make further and faster use of their powers to close venues that are breaking the rules and pose a risk to public health.
Fines will be levied against hospitality venues that fail to ensure their premises remain COVID Secure.
We will boost the enforcement capacity of local authorities by introducing COVID Secure Marshalls to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres, and by setting up a register of Environmental Health Officers that local authorities can draw upon for support.
We will simplify the Passenger Locator Form needed for travelling to the UK, and take measures to ensure these are completed and checked before departure.
Border Force will step up enforcement efforts at the border to ensure arrivals are complying with the quarantine rules.
We will also restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in some local areas.

At the present time we must also, I’m afraid, revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums and conference centres from 1 October. That doesn’t mean we’re going to scrap the programme entirely it just means we are going to review and abridge it, and the Culture Secretary will say more shortly. Let me be clear – these measures are not a second national lockdown – the whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown. By bearing down on social contact and improving enforcement, we can keep schools and businesses open, in the knowledge they are COVID Secure. I have always said schools and colleges should only ever be shut again as a very, very last resort. As the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser have said, the long term risks to children’s life chances of not going to school are significant and far greater than the health risks of going back to school. Indeed it’s been fantastic to see so many children back in school this term and I want, once again, to thank all our teachers, and to reassure parents and pupils that schools are safe. University terms will also begin soon. Opening universities is critical, again, for students’ life chances and, again, the health risks to individuals are low. Of course, many university students are in the age bracket where we have seen the infection rates rise recently as Chris was just explaining. My message to students is simple. Please, for the sake of your education and your parents’ and your grandparents’ health: wash your hands, cover your face, make space, and don’t socially gather in groups of more than 6, now and when term starts. Today the Department for Education is publishing updated guidance for universities on how they can operate in a COVID Secure way, including a clear request not to send students home in the event of an outbreak, so as to avoid spreading the virus across the country. I am very grateful to universities for their continued cooperation and planning for the return of students. The measures I have set out today will help us control the virus but won’t, on their own, be enough to allow a more significant return to normality. Patrick is going to set out in a moment where we are on vaccines and treatments in a moment, but we are not there yet and there are no guarantees. So over the summer, we have therefore been working up an alternative plan which could allow life to return closer to normality. And that plan is based on mass testing. Up to now, we have used testing primarily to identify people who are positive – so we can isolate them from the community and protect high risk groups. And that will continue to be our priority. We are working hard to increase our testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. But in future, in the near future, we want to start using testing to identify people who are negative – who don’t have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else with the virus. And we think, we hope, we believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved – literally millions of tests processed every single day. That level of testing would allow people to lead more normal lives, without the need for social distancing: Theatres and sports venues could test all audience members on the day and let in those with a negative result, all those who are not infectious.
Workplaces could be opened up to all those who test negative that morning and allow them to behave in a way that was normal before COVID.
Those isolating because they are a contact, or quarantining after travelling abroad, could after a period be tested and released.
Now that is an ambitious agenda, but we are going to pilot this approach in Salford from next month, with audiences in indoor and outdoor venues. And then we hope to go nationwide. There are a number of challenges. We need the technology to work. We need to source the necessary materials to manufacture so many tests. We need to put in place an efficient distribution network. And we need to work through the numerous logistical challenges. And as I say, we are not there yet, and I should repeat that, as we manage this period of high demand, it is especially important that if individuals don’t have symptoms, and have not been specifically advised to take a test, they should not be coming forward for a test - because they could be taking a test away from someone who really needs it. Our plan – this moonshot that I am describing – will require a giant, collaborative effort from government, business, public health professionals, scientists, logistics experts and many, many more. Work is underway – and we will get on at pace until we get there, round the clock. We are hopeful this approach will be widespread by the spring and, if everything comes together, it may be possible even for challenging sectors like theatres to have life much closer to normal before Christmas. But as I have said before, all this progress is contingent on continued scientific advances and though we’re hopeful, I cannot 100% guarantee that those advances will be made. That is why it is so important that we take these tough measures now. I believe we will continue to drive this virus down and that we will beat this virus before too long. So let’s work together and follow the rules: meet in groups of no more than six. Wash your hands, cover your face, and make space. I will now hand over to Patrick to set out the latest on vaccines and treatments, and then we’ll go to questions from the public and the media. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 31 July 2020 Good afternoon, Two weeks ago, I updated you from this podium on the progress we had made as a country against coronavirus.
And in many ways that progress continues. The number of patients admitted to hospitals is still falling, and now stands at just over 100 each day.
In April there were more than 3,000 coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, but now the latest figure is 87. The number of deaths continues to fall. That is obviously encouraging But I have also consistently warned that this virus could come back and that we would not hesitate to take swift and decisive action as required. I am afraid that in parts of Asia and Latin America the virus is now gathering pace. And our European friends are also struggling to keep the virus under control. As we see these rises around the world, we cannot fool ourselves that we are exempt. We must be willing to react to the first signs of trouble. Today, the weekly survey by the Office for National Statistics reports that the prevalence of the virus in the community in England is likely to be rising for the first time since May. Around 1 in 1,500 now have the virus, compared to 1 in 1,800 on 15 July and 1 in 2,000 on 2 July. The ONS also estimate there are now 4,900 new infections every day, up from around 3,000 per day on 14 July and 2,000 per day at the end of June We can’t afford to ignore this evidence. It’s vital to stress that we are in a far better position to keep the virus under control now than we were at the start of the pandemic – because we know so much more about the virus and have so many more tools at our disposal to deal with it. Our testing capacity has increased 100-fold. We have a contact tracing system up and running which has led to over 184,000 people isolating who may otherwise have spread the virus and is capable of tracing thousands of contacts every day. We have secured supplies of billions of items of PPE to withstand new demands on hospitals and care homes. And of course we have new treatments, like dexamethasone and remdesivir, to shorten recovery times and reduce mortality rates. But as I say, we cannot be complacent. I cannot – I won’t stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country. Last night the Health Secretary announced new restrictions on household contact in the North West – specifically Greater Manchester, and parts of East Lancashire and West Yorkshire. These are targeted measures on social contact between households, which the data tells us is driving the current increase in cases. Businesses and workplaces should continue as before in those areas.I know how it is hard to have restrictions like this imposed on seeing your family and your friends. But we have to act rapidly in order to protect those we love. And we know this sort of intervention works – measures taken in Leicester and Luton have suppressed the virus, allowing us to relax measures. Even as we act locally, it is also my responsibility to look again at the measures we have in place nationally in light of the data we are seeing about incidence. At every point I have said our plan to reopen society and the economy is conditional – that it relies on continued progress against the virus, and that we would not hesitate to put on the brakes if required. With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control. On Saturday 1 August, you’ll remember, we had hoped to reopen in England a number of higher risk settings that had remained closed. Today, I am afraid we are postponing these changes for at least a fortnight. That means that, until 15 August at the earliest: Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and remaining close contact services must remain closed.
Indoor performances will not resume. Pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place. Wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted, but ceremonies can continue to take place, in line with COVID-Secure guidelines. I know that the steps we are taking will be a heavy blow to many people – to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted, or who now cannot celebrate Eid in the way they would wish, I am really, really sorry about that. But we simply cannot take the risk. We will of course study the data carefully and move forward with our intention to open up as soon as we possibly can. Two weeks ago, I also said that from tomorrow the government would give employers more discretion over how employees can work safely – whether by continuing to work from home or attending a Covid Secure workplace. We know that employers have gone to huge lengths to make workplaces safe, so that guidance remains unchanged.
We also said we would pause shielding nationally from 1 August – based on clinical advice, that national pause will proceed as planned, and our medical experts will be explaining more about that decision later and about shielding later today. Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus. But we must keep our discipline, we must be focused and we cannot be complacent. I have asked the Home Secretary to work with the police and others to ensure the rules which are already in place are properly enforced. That means local authorities acting to close down premises and cancel events which are not following Covid Secure guidance. And it means a greater police presence to ensure face coverings are being worn where this is required by law.
We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet, such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.
We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings, and this will become enforceable in law from 8 August. At this stage, we are not changing the rules on social contact nationally. I don’t want to tell people to spend less time with their friends. But unless people follow the rules and behave safely, we may need to go further.
Two weeks ago, I said we would hope for the best but plan for the worst. And of course we continue to hope for the best. The way to get there and to achieve that optimum outcome is if we all follow the rules, wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance – and get a test if we have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control. This is how we will avoid a return to full national lockdown. We’ve made huge progress together. I know we are going succeed and I know we are going to beat this – if each and every one of us plays our part. 

Boris:


PM statement on coronavirus 17 July Good morning, In the two weeks since I last addressed you from this podium, I am pleased to report that we have continued to make steady progress in our collective effort to beat the coronavirus. For 3 weeks now, the number of new cases identified through testing each day has been below 1,000. The latest SAGE advice is that, across the UK, the R rate remains between 0.7 and 0.9. SAGE also assess that the number of infections is shrinking by between 5 and 1 per cent every day. The latest ONS data shows prevalence and new infections to be stable and low. The number of patients newly admitted to hospital with coronavirus each day, and the number of coronavirus patients in mechanical ventilation beds, have both fallen by more than 90% from their peak in early April. And while we mourn every death, the average daily death rate continues, steadily, to fall. This progress is testament to the phenomenal efforts of our NHS and social care staff working tirelessly on the frontline. And it has only been possible thanks to the character and fortitude with which you, the British people, have made fundamental changes to the way you all live and work. When we set out our plan to rebuild on 11 May, we said our goal was to return life to as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and as fairly as possible, in a way that is safe and continues to protect our NHS. That goal remains the same – but the tools we use to achieve it are changing. At the start of the pandemic, when we knew far less about the nature and spread of the virus, we had to take blanket, national measures. National lockdown was undoubtedly the right thing to do and has saved many thousands of lives. Now however, we know more about the virus – we understand the epidemiology better and our intelligence on where it is spreading is vastly improved. That means we can control it through targeted, local action instead. In England, this work is led by NHS Test and Trace and within it the Joint Biosecurity Centre. My sincere thanks go to Dido Harding who oversees this work and who joins me today. This approach is already working. In Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees, we took swift and successful action to contain outbreaks at specific premises. In Bradford and Blackburn with Darwen, we identified troubling trends in the data and worked closely with the respective local authorities to increase testing and take targeted action. That work continues. And in Leicester, we instituted a local lockdown in order to bear down on stubborn rates of infection. As the Health Secretary announced last night, we will begin to relax the restrictions there next week. We can do so because the data is improving – with the percentage of people testing positive falling from a weekly rate of 12.2% on 29 June to 4.8% yesterday. The approach varies in different parts of the UK, but all parts of the UK benefit from the support of our armed forces, additional testing facilities, and billions of pounds of support provided by this Government. Today we are publishing our framework for containing and controlling future outbreaks in England, which will enable national and local government to work closely together. From tomorrow, local authorities will have new powers in their areas. They will be able to close specific premises, shut public outdoor spaces, and cancel events. These powers will enable local authorities to act more quickly in response to outbreaks, where speed is paramount. Action by local councils will not always be sufficient. So next week we will publish draft regulations which clearly set out how central government can intervene more effectively at a local level. Where justified by the evidence, ministers will be able to close whole sectors or types of premises in an area, introduce local “stay at home” orders, prevent people entering or leaving defined areas, reduce the maximum size of gatherings beyond national rules, or restrict transport systems serving local areas. I know that it will be hard going for people affected by these local measures. It isn’t easy, and for some it may seem unjust that people just a short distance away can live their lives closer to normal. But it has to be right that we take local action in response to local outbreaks – there is no point shutting down a city in one part of the country to contain an outbreak in another part of the country. Now of course, this local approach relies on having an effective testing regime in place. And here we have made substantial progress. Antigen test capacity – that’s the test which tells you if you currently have the virus – has increased 100-fold since the start of March, from fewer than 2,000 tests a day to more than 200,000 tests a day now. Publicly available data suggests we are now carrying out our tests more than anywhere else in Europe in total, and more tests than Germany, France, Italy and Spain per capita. We have set up testing sites around the UK and now have 200 mobile units which can be rapidly deployed wherever they are needed. It is now the case, and has been for some time, that anyone, anywhere in the UK with symptoms can get a test without delay. We are also testing increasing numbers of people who don’t have symptoms but who are at higher risk. As we approach winter, we will need to go further – not least as many more people will show Covid-like symptoms as a result of seasonal illnesses, and therefore require a test. So we will further increase testing capacity to at least half a million antigen tests a day – 3.5 million antigen tests a week – by the end of October. Demand for testing is not the only challenge that winter will bring. It is possible that the virus will be more virulent in the winter months – and it is certain that the NHS will face the usual, annual winter pressures. We have taken a number of steps therefore to get the NHS ready for winter. We have massively increased the number of ventilators available to patients across the UK – up from 9,000 before the pandemic to nearly 30,000 now. We have substantially increased the pipeline of personal protective equipment for the NHS and social care -constituting over 30 billion items of PPE over the course of the pandemic. We will be rolling out the biggest ever flu vaccination programme in the history of the U.K. And we will also of course give the NHS the resources it needs. And today, I can confirm that we are providing an additional £3 billion of funding to the NHS in England to get ready for winter. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive additional funds. This will allow the NHS to continue to use the extra hospital capacity acquired from the independent sector and also to maintain the Nightingale hospitals until the end of March. This new funding comes on top of the additional £30 billion of funding for health and social care that we have already announced this year. So we are making sure we are ready for winter, and planning for the worst. But even as we plan for the worst, I strongly believe we should also hope for the best. That means looking ahead with optimism – now extending our plan to lift the remaining national measures which have restricted our lives since March so we can get back to something closer to normal life. Now I must stress, the timetable I am about to set out is conditional. It is contingent on every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly. It relies on our continued success in controlling the virus. And we will not proceed if doing so risks a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS. Nonetheless, it is important to give people hope and to give business confidence. So in England, from today we are making clear that anybody may use public transport, while of course encouraging people to consider alternative means of transport where they are available. From 25 July, we have already committed to reopening the indoor gyms, pools and other sports facilities. From 1 August, we will update our advice on going to work. Instead of government telling people to work from home, we are going to give employers more discretion, and ask them to make decisions about how their staff can work safely. That could mean of course continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees. Or it could mean making workplaces safe by following Covid Secure guidelines. Whatever employers decide, they should consult closely with their employees, and only ask people to return to their place of work if it is safe. As we reopen our society and economy, it’s right that we give employers more discretion while continuing to ensure employees are kept safe. Also from 1 August, we will reopen most remaining leisure settings, namely bowling, skating rinks and casinos, and we will enable all close contact services such as beauticians to resume. Nightclubs and soft play areas will sadly need to remain closed for now – although this will be kept under review. We will restart indoor performances to a live audience, subject to the success of pilots, and we will also pilot larger gatherings in venues like sports stadia, with a view to wider reopening in the Autumn. We will also allow wedding receptions for up to 30 people. All of these measures for 1 August should be done in a Covid Secure way. In September, schools, nurseries and colleges will be open for all children and young people on a full-time basis, as planned. And universities are also working to reopen as fully as possible. From October, we intend to bring back audiences in stadia and to allow conferences and other business events to recommence – again, these changes must be done in a Covid Secure way, subject to the successful outcome of pilots. Throughout this period, we will look to allow more close contact between friends and family when we can. It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest – possibly in time for Christmas. At all times, we will continue to work with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to support and care for those at risk, wherever they live in the UK. We have said that the shielding programme for those most at risk in England, the clinically extremely vulnerable, will be paused at the end of this month. We will stay constantly vigilant and be sure to restart shielding at any point if required. Now I know some will say this plan is too optimistic, that the risks are too great and that we won’t overcome the virus in time. And of course, if they are right in saying that, and we cannot exclude that they are, let me reassure them, and reassure you: that we will not hesitate at any stage to put on the brakes. From May 11 onwards, this plan has been conditional, and it remains conditional. But if we continue to pull together as we have done so far, I know we can beat this virus. Hoping for the best, but planning for the worst – and it’s in that spirit that we must carry on waging this long, hard fight against Coronavirus. I’ll now hand over to Dido. 

Boris:


Good evening, Since I last spoke to you from this podium, we have continued to make progress nationally against the virus. We are now reporting regularly fewer than 1,000 new cases each day. The Office for National Statistics estimates that between 14 June and 27 June, the most recent period they have analysed, 25,000 people in the community in England had the virus – 1 person in every 2,200. SAGE assess that the R rate – the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto – remains between 0.7 and 0.9 across the UK. SAGE also assess that, in England, the number of new infections is shrinking by between 2 and 5% every day. And while the number of people dying with coronavirus remains too high, the numbers do continue to fall. Now of course this picture is not universal. There are areas – such as Leicester – where the virus is still more prevalent than we would like. We always said there would be local outbreaks requiring local action. This is to be expected and will, I’m afraid, be a feature of our lives for some time to come. But that should not take away from the great progress we have made, together, as a country against this vicious disease. This progress is the reason why we have been able – slowly, carefully, cautiously – to ease the national lockdown. Without doubt, lockdown has saved many hundreds of thousands of lives – but it has also had a devastating impact on our way of life and our economy. And of course, lockdown has not yet been lifted entirely. Indoor gyms, nail bars and swimming pools are still closed, mass gatherings are still prohibited, social distancing is still essential. I want these restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible – of course I do. We have established taskforces to work rapidly and closely with the sectors that remain closed to explore how they can be Covid Secure. I am pleased to report good progress is being made. Next week we will set out a timetable for their re-opening – though of course I can only lift those remaining, national restrictions as and when it is safe to do so. Our goal remains to enable as many people as possible to live their lives as close to normally as possible – in a way which is as fair and as safe as possible. To achieve this we need to move away from blanket, national measures, to targeted, local measures. So instead of locking down the whole country, we will lock down specific premises or local areas where the virus is spreading. Instead of closing down non-essential retail and hospitality nationwide, we will only shut establishments locally as required. Instead of shutting all schools for most pupils, from September we will only shut those schools where it is absolutely necessary to control an outbreak. And instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is, sadly, not yet under control. We are already implementing this targeted approach in England. In Weston-Super-Mare, we identified an outbreak in a hospital, closed it to visitors and new admissions, tested all staff and patients and gave the hospital a deep clean. The outbreak was contained and the hospital is open again. In Kirklees, we identified an outbreak at a meat packing plant, shut down the plant, moved in a mobile testing unit, tested all employees and traced the contacts of those who were positive. The outbreak was contained and the plant has reopened with additional safety measures in place. And of course more recently in Leicester, we identified a community-wide outbreak which was not restricted to a single location, unlike Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees. Public Health England engaged with the local authority, mobile testing units were deployed, full data was shared – council-wide data was shared on 11 June, and postcode-level data was shared last week. This enhanced monitoring through additional testing showed that the infection rate in Leicester was three times the next highest infection rate in any other city in the country. So on Monday, the Health Secretary announced local lockdown measures in Leicester for an initial period of 2 weeks. In each of these cases, the problems identified were specific to Weston-Super-Mare, Kirklees and Leicester. So of course it made sense to take action locally, rather than re-impose restrictions on the whole country. And we are learning the whole time. With each local outbreak, we see what works well and what not so well, so that we do better next time. Informed by our experience of these cases, we have developed an approach for controlling future local outbreaks which has five principle components: monitoring, engagement, testing, targeted restrictions and finally, as a last resort, lockdown. First, monitoring. Public Health England, working with the Joint Biosecurity Centre, will examine carefully data on the spread of the disease and people’s behaviour across the country. They will look out for emerging trends, rising case numbers and other indicators, while taking into account local factors. Critically, we have made local data available to all Directors of Public Health in local authorities, so they too can monitor what is happening in their area. And local data will also be available to the public on the gov.uk dashboard. Second, engagement. If monitoring identifies local problems, NHS Test and Trace and PHE will work with the relevant local authority to develop a deeper understanding of the problem and identify solutions. Working with local agencies, we will seek to keep the local community informed at every stage, so they know what is happening and what actions, if any, they need to take. Third, testing. We now have substantial testing capacity nationwide and we have the ability to target that capacity at local areas in order to get a grip on emerging outbreaks. Scaled-up testing at a local level, combined with contract tracing through NHS Test and Trace, can control the virus and thus avoid more stringent measures. Fourth, targeted restrictions. If the virus continues to spread, we will restrict activities at particular locations and close individual premises. As in Weston-Super-Mare and Kirklees, we will restrict access to places which become hotspots for the virus, while testing people who have spent time in those places, and tracing the contacts of anyone who tests positive. Fifth, local lockdown. If the previous measures have not proven to be enough, we will introduce local lockdowns extending across whole communities. As in Leicester, that could mean shutting businesses venues that would otherwise be open, closing schools or urging people once more to stay at home. Local lockdowns will be carefully calibrated depending on the scientific and specific circumstances of each outbreak and we are continually exploring smarter means of containing the virus. So that is the approach we will take as local outbreaks occur and we will set out more detail soon. Let me end by looking forward to this weekend. Tomorrow, there will be a moment of remembrance for those whose lives have tragically been lost before their time. And at 5pm on Sunday, the NHS’s 72nd birthday, we can all come together to clap those who have worked tirelessly and selflessly to help the nation get through this pandemic. I know everyone will be looking forward to the relaxation of national restrictions. As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, B&amp;Bs, indeed much of our tourism industry. All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down. Lockdown only succeeded in controlling the virus because everyone worked together, and we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together again. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that. If it starts running out of control again this Government will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions. Anyone who flouts social distancing and COVID-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal. So as we take this next step, our biggest step yet, on the road to recovery, I urge the British people to do so safely. Remember – don’t gather in groups of more than 6 outside or 2 households in any setting. Keep your distance from those outside your household – 2 metres if you can, 1 metre with precautions if you can’t. Wash your hands. Let’s all stay alert, control the virus, save lives – and enjoy summer safely. 

Boris:


The Prime Minister leading the coronavirus press conference on 23 June 2020 Good evening, Could I have the first slide please? On 16 April, we set out our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and since then they have guided our path out of lockdown. At every stage, we have diligently assessed our progress against these five tests before making changes. It has meant that we have, so far, avoided the catastrophe of a second peak of infection that could have overwhelmed the NHS and meant so many more lives lost. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. Well, the NHS has coped fantastically under the extraordinary pressure of this extraordinary pandemic. On 20 June, 283 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - down from 438 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April. And on 22 June, 340 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. These numbers provide confidence that we are still meeting the first test. Next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so that we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. Of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, it saddens me to report that 42,927 have now died. 171 fatalities were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm yesterday. A further 109 deaths which occurred in April, May and June have been identified and added to the total. As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 121, down from 216 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. The second test is, therefore, still being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. In total, 306,210 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 874 cases since yesterday. The seven day rolling average of new positive cases is now 1,147, down from 1,543 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 on 14 April. Approximately one in 1,700 people in the community in England are now estimated to have the virus, down from 1 in 400 four weeks ago. SAGE believes infections across the UK are shrinking at a steady rate of between 4 and 2 per cent every day. Based on all the various data available, the government is confident the third test is being met. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. Yesterday 237,142 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The new NHS Test and Trace service has already advised over 87,000 people to self-isolate who might otherwise have unwittingly transmitted the virus. We have contracted with over 175 new suppliers able to deliver PPE at the scale and pace the UK requires. And this progress means we are satisfied that the fourth test is being met. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am once again grateful for the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out. I can confirm the government judges we have met the fifth test and we are therefore satisfied that all five tests are still being met. On 11 May, we set out our plan to recover. That plan as you may remember set out three steps for adjusting the lockdown. Step 1 was implemented, as planned, on 13 May, enabling people to spend more time outdoors. Step 2 was implemented, as planned, in phases on    1 and 15 June. Shops have opened, children have started to return to school and people have been able to see more of their loved ones. Now Step 3 can be implemented, as planned, on 4 July. All the measures I am about to set out apply to England - the devolved administrations are responsible for adjusting lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, moving at the pace they believe is right for them. After a long period of asking you, the British public, to follow very strict and complex rules to bring coronavirus under control, we can now make life easier for people to see more of their friends and family, and to help businesses get back on their feet and people back into jobs. Critically, we can make a change to the guidance on two metres, which kept us safe while transmission of the virus was high but which can now be modified. Having considered all the evidence, while staying at two metres is preferable, we can now move to “1 metre plus” where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart. This means staying one metre apart, plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. These precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing handwashing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside your household, and of course being outdoors. On public transport, it means one metre plus wearing a face covering for mitigation, as everybody I think now understands. We are setting out COVID-Secure guidance to help businesses take the measures that are right for them. We can also allow more sectors to reopen on 4 July, as planned for Step 3. So, from 4 July, the following premises will be allowed to reopen provided they are COVID-Secure: 
hotels, bed and breakfasts and self-contained holiday accommodation
caravan parks and campsites
places of worship and libraries
restaurants and cafes
bars, pubs and social clubs
cinemas and bingo halls
museums and galleries
hair salons and barbers
outdoor playgrounds and outdoor gyms

This has been an incredibly tough time for these establishments. But I hope that everyone working in them can take confidence in knowing they will be able to open their doors once again in just a couple of weeks’ time. And of course they should do so in a way that is COVID-Secure, keeping customers and staff safe. But I am afraid to say that some premises, such as nightclubs, swimming pools and indoor gyms, must remain closed for now given the particular risks of transmission in those settings. However, we are establishing taskforces for those sectors to establish how they too can open, in a COVID-Secure way, as fast as possible. At the same time, we can give people more freedom to see their friends and family. From 4 July, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time, including staying over. This can be indoors or outside, at your home, in a restaurant or pub, or in paid accommodation. I want to stress you should remain socially distant from anyone outside your household. For meeting outdoors, you can continue to meet in a park or a garden in a group of up to six people, drawn from six different households. Again, at all times you should maintain social distancing from anyone outside your household. As we give people back more control over their lives, we will be asking them to follow guidance on limiting their social contact, rather than forcing them to do so through legislation. And this obviously requires everyone to act responsibly, which I have no doubt they will do. It will still be possible for the police to break up large and irresponsible gatherings. But neither the police themselves, or the public that they serve, want virtually every aspect of our behaviour to be subject to the criminal law. Yesterday the Deputy Chief Medical Officer and the Health Secretary set out updated advice for those who are shielding in England, so that they can soon start to return to leading more normal lives. Opening up more of Britain in this COVID-Secure way is only possible if everyone continues to stay alert to the risks of coronavirus. That means you should: 
stay 2 metres apart and if you can’t do that then keep 1 metre apart with mitigations
wash your hands regularly
wear face coverings on public transport, or where you are indoors in a crowded environment where distancing is not possible
follow the rules when visiting businesses
crucially, get a test done immediately if you develop symptoms
and self-isolate if you are asked to by NHS Test and Trace

We are only able to make these changes because we have persevered together and stuck to our path. We had five tests - and we met them. We had a plan - and we stuck to it. The government has asked a huge amount of all of you, and the people of this country have met that challenge with good humour and common sense. Of course, the fight is far from over. This is a nasty virus still that wants to take advantage of our carelessness. I’m afraid there will be local outbreaks. And I must tell you that if the virus were to begin to run out of control, I will not hesitate to put on the handbrake on and reverse some of these changes, at a local or indeed national level as required. But we can avoid that if we all continue to stay alert and do our bit to control the virus. The British public have proved again and again, not that it was ever in doubt it, that they can be trusted to do the right thing and to do it with common sense. There is no doubt we are beating back this virus and, with your continued cooperation and good judgment we will beat it once and for all. I’ll now hand over to Patrick. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the families and friends of James Furlong, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and David Wails, who were brutally killed in Reading on Saturday. To assault defenceless people in a park is not simply an act of wickedness but abject cowardice, and we will never yield to those who would seek to destroy our way of life. Mr Speaker, with permission I will update the House on the next steps in our plan to rebuild our economy and reopen our society, while waging our struggle against Covid-19. From the outset, we have trusted in the common sense and perseverance of the British people and their response has more than justified our faith. Since I set out our plan on the 11th May, we have been clear that our cautious relaxation of the guidance is entirely conditional on our continued defeat of the virus. In the first half of May, nearly 69,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK; by the first half of June, that total had fallen by nearly 70 percent to just under 22,000. The number of new infections is now declining by between 2 and 4 percent every day. Four weeks ago, an average of 1 in 400 people in the community in England had COVID-19; in the first half of June, this figure was 1 in 1,700. We created a human shield around the NHS and in turn our doctors and nurses have protected us, and together we have saved our hospitals from being overwhelmed. On the 11th May, 1,073 people were admitted to hospital in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with Covid-19, by 20th June, this had fallen by 74 per cent to 283. This pandemic has inflicted permanent scars and we mourn everyone we have lost. Measured by a seven-day rolling average, the number of daily deaths peaked at 943 on the 14th April, on 11th May it was 476, and yesterday, the rolling average stood at 130. We have ordered over 2.2 billion items of protective equipment from UK based manufacturers, many of whose production lines have been called into being to serve this new demand - and yesterday, we conducted or posted 139,659 tests, bringing the total to over 8 million. And while we remain vigilant, we do not believe there is currently a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS. Taking everything together, we continue to meet our five tests and the Chief Medical Officers of all four home nations have downgraded the UK’s Covid Alert Level from four to three, meaning that we no longer face a virus spreading exponentially, though it remains in general circulation. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland hold responsibility for their own lockdown restrictions and they will respond to the united view of the Chief Medical Officers at their own pace, based on their own judgment, but all parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction and we will continue to work together to ensure that everyone in our country gets the support they need. Thanks to our progress, we can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England. At every stage, caution will remain our watchword, and each step will be conditional and reversible. Mr Speaker, given the significant fall in the prevalence of the virus, we can change the two-metre social distancing rule, from 4th July. I know this rule effectively makes life impossible for large parts of our economy, even without other restrictions. For example, it prevents all but a fraction of our hospitality industry from operating. So that is why almost two weeks ago, I asked our experts to conduct a review and I will place a summary of their conclusions in the libraries of both Houses this week. Where it is possible to keep 2 metres apart people should. But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of ‘one metre plus’, meaning they should remain one metre apart, while taking mitigations to reduce the risk of transmission. We are today publishing guidance on how businesses can reduce the risk by taking certain steps to protect workers and customers. These include, for instance, avoiding face-to-face seating by changing office layouts, reducing the number of people in enclosed spaces, improving ventilation, using protective screens and face coverings, closing non-essential social spaces, providing hand sanitiser and changing shift patterns so that staff work in set teams. And of course, we already mandate face coverings on public transport. Whilst the experts cannot give a precise assessment of how much the risk is reduced, they judge these mitigations would make “1 metre plus” broadly equivalent to the risk at 2 metres if those mitigations are fully implemented. Either will be acceptable and our guidance will change accordingly. This vital change enables the next stage of our plan to ease the lockdown. Mr Speaker, I am acutely conscious people will ask legitimate questions about why certain activities are allowed and others are not. I must ask the House to understand that the virus has no interest in these debates. Its only interest, its only ambition is to exploit any opportunities is to recapture ground that we might carelessly vacate. There is one certainty: the fewer social contacts you have, the safer you will be. My duty, our duty as the Government, is to guide the British people, balancing our overriding aim of controlling the virus against our natural desire to bring back normal life. We cannot lift all the restrictions at once, so we have to make difficult judgments, and every step is scrupulously weighed against the evidence. Our principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks, remembering that the more we open up, the more vigilant we will need to be. From now on we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact instead of legislation. In that spirit we advise that from 4 July, two households of any size should be able to meet in any setting inside or out. That does not mean they must always be the same two households. It will be possible for instance to meet one set of grandparents one weekend, and the others the following weekend. We are not recommending meetings of multiple households indoors because of the risk of creating greater chains of transmission. Outside, the guidance remains that people from several households can meet in groups of up to six. and it follows that two households can also meet, regardless of size. Mr Speaker, I can tell the House that we will also re-open restaurants and pubs. All hospitality indoors will be limited to table-service, and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact. We will ask businesses to help NHS Test and Trace respond to any local outbreaks by collecting contact details from customers, as happens in other countries, and we will work with the sector to make this manageable. Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me, and so we will re-open hairdressers, with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors. We also intend to allow some other close contact services, such as nail bars, to re-open as soon as we can, when we are confident they can operate in a Covid-secure way. From 4th July, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed &amp; breakfasts, as well as campsites as long as shared facilities are kept clean. Most leisure facilities and tourist attractions will reopen if they can do so safely, including outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades as well as libraries, social clubs and community centres. “Close proximity” venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools and spas will need to remain closed for now, as will bowling alleys and water parks. But my RHFs the Business and Culture Secretaries will establish taskforces with public health experts and these sectors to help them become Covid-secure and re-open as soon as possible. We will also work with the arts industry on specific guidance to enable choirs, orchestras and theatres to resume live performances as soon as possible. Recreation and sport will be allowed, but indoor facilities, including changing rooms and courts, will remain closed and people should only play close contact team sports with members of their household. Mr Speaker, I know that many have mourned the closure of places of worship, and this year, Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown. So I am delighted that places of worship will be able to reopen for prayer and services – including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing. Meanwhile, our courts, probation services, police stations and other public services will increasingly resume face-to-face proceedings. Wrap-around care for school age children and formal childcare will restart over the summer. Primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance and those children who can already go to school should do so – because it is safe. Mr Speaker, we will publish Covid-secure guidelines for every sector that is re-opening, and slowly but surely, these measures will restore a sense of normality. After the toughest restrictions in peacetime history, we are now able to make life easier for people to see more of their friends and families and to help businesses get back on their feet and get people back into work. But the virus has not gone away. We will continue to monitor the data with the Joint Biosecurity Centre and our ever more effective Test and Trace system. And I must be clear to the House, that as we have seen in other countries, there will be flare-ups for which local measures will be needed and we will not hesitate to apply the brakes and re-introduce restrictions even at national level - if required. So I urge everyone to stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Let’s keep washing our hands, staying 2 metres apart wherever feasible, and mitigating the risks at 1 metre where not, avoiding public transport when possible, and wearing a mask when not, getting tested immediately if we have symptoms, and self-isolating if instructed by NHS Test and Trace. Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our shops, streets and homes and a new, but cautious, optimism is palpable. But it would be all too easy for that frost to return and that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through and see us to victory over this virus. I commend Mr Speaker this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


coronavirus press conference 16 June 2020 Good evening, I am delighted to be joined today by the Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and by Professor Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health. Today I’m actually going to let them do most of the talking as they have some news to share on a new treatment for coronavirus. But I’ll start by updating you briefly on the latest data. Can I have the first slide please? 

6,981,493 tests for coronavirus carried out or posted out in the UK. This includes 113,107 carried out or posted out yesterday. 

298,136 have tested positive, an increase of 1,279 cases since yesterday. 

The second slide shows the latest data from hospitals: 

410 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 June, that’s down from 438 a week earlier, and down from a peak of 3,432 on 1 April. 

385 coronavirus patients are currently in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 513 a week ago, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. 

The third slide shows what is happening in hospitals across the country: 
There are now 5,254 people in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down 16% from 6,282 a week ago and down from a peak of 20,698 on 12 April.

The fourth slide shows the daily figures for those who have sadly lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus: 
And across all settings, the total number of deaths now stands at 41,969. That’s an increase of 233 fatalities since yesterday.

Although those figures are very sad, they do show that we are making good progress in controlling the spread of the virus. Tests are up and cases are down. Hospital admissions are down. The numbers of patients in hospital overall - and specifically those on mechanical ventilation beds - are both down. And of course while each death is one too many, deaths are coming down too. That progress of course has only been possible thanks to the dedication of the British people as we work together to beat this virus. By observing the lockdown, and sacrificing contact with friends and families, everybody has played their part in bringing the virus under control. It is critical now that we hold our nerve – and we don’t throw away the progress we have made. On the 11 May I set out our plan to help our country recover and we are working through it, carefully and deliberately. At each stage we have only proceeded when the evidence suggests it is safe to do so, ensuring our five tests for adjusting the lockdown continue to be met. And yesterday it was great to see our shops open their doors again. Our retail sector has done a fantastic job to make sure they are Covid Secure, meaning they can open in a safe way for staff and for customers. It is great to see so many people out shopping whilst observing social distancing – and that is so important to limiting the spread of the virus. It has also been very good to see more, and more children back at school this week, with some secondary pupils returning for face-to-face contact with their teachers ahead of the exams next year. And I want to say to all parents whose children are eligible to return to school, I want to assure you it is safe – and there is no need for your kids to miss out on their education, I hope they will go to school. I know that people want us to go further – with our changes to social distancing measures and I am all too aware the 2 metre rule has big implications for schools and many other sectors, and I absolutely hear those concerns and will do everything in my power to get us back to normal as soon possible. But we must proceed carefully, and according to our plan. I am still committed to the central goal to get back to life as close to normal as possible, for as many people as possible, as fast and fairly as possible… and in a way that minimises the risk of a new epidemic, minimises the risk to life and maximises our chances of a string economic and social recovery. Our plan sets out that the next step of adjusting lockdown - for personal care, for the hospitality and leisure sector, for gatherings in places of worship and other public places – a lot more to come and that as you know will happen no sooner than 4 July. I remain committed to that plan, and will say more soon about how we intend to take it forward. Today, the global efforts to find a long-term solution to the pandemic continue, through a vaccine or effective treatment. And I am delighted that the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a fantastic team of scientists right here in the UK. I am not really qualified to announce on this drug and its effects but I will ask Sir Patrick and Professor Horby to say more in a moment. But I am so proud of these British scientists, backed by UK Government funding, who have led the first robust clinical trial anywhere in the world to find a coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of death. And I am very grateful to the thousands of patients in this country who volunteered for the trials – thank you. This drug - dexamethasone – can now be made available across the NHS. And we have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak. Of course, while the chances of dying from Covid-19 have been significantly reduced by this treatment, they are still far too high. So we must redouble our research efforts and we certainly will. But today, there is genuine cause to celebrate a great, British achievement and the benefits it will bring not just in this country but around the world. I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, Before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the memory of Jo Cox, who was cruelly murdered four years ago today. Her sister, Kim Leadbeater, spoke for us all when she urged everyone to remember Jo by pulling together with “compassion and kindness”. I was concerned to learn that the Hon Member for East Dunbartonshire is now in hospital: we send her our best wishes. Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement about the ambitions of a Global Britain and the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are living through a daily demonstration of how events on the far side of the world influence not only British security and prosperity, but something as elemental as the state of our health, and whether we can go to work or buy our daily bread. This crisis offers vivid proof of the seminal importance of international engagement and exactly why our country must perform its global role. I have begun the biggest review of our foreign, defence and development policy since the end of the Cold War, designed to maximise our influence and integrate all the strands of our international effort. The overriding aim is to bring this country’s strengths and expertise to bear on the world’s biggest problems, seizing the opportunities of Britain’s presidency of the G7 next year and the UN climate change conference, COP26, which we will host in Glasgow. The UK possesses the third biggest aid budget and diplomatic network in the world: we owe it to our people to make best use of these assets, which scarcely any of our peers can match. The British taxpayer has the right to expect that we achieve the maximum value with every pound we spend. One cardinal lesson of the pandemic is that distinctions between diplomacy and overseas development are artificial and outdated. For instance, to protect ourselves against another calamity, the UK will need to work alongside our friends to strengthen international bodies like the World Health Organization, and help vulnerable countries to improve their health systems and achieve greater resilience. It makes no sense to ask whether this amounts to aid or foreign policy: they are one and the same endeavour, and they’re designed to achieve the same goals, which are right in themselves and serve our national interest. On 4th June I chaired a virtual summit of the global vaccine alliance, which raised enough money to immunise 300 million children. I doubt whether any other occasion will save more lives, and avoid more suffering, or produce a better example of the good this country can do by its international engagement – in the true and broad sense - alongside our friends. And yet today – as anyone with experience of it will know - a dividing line between aid and foreign policy runs through our whole system, with our Department for International Development working independently from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and our aid budget parcelled out between different arms of Whitehall. DFID outspends the Foreign Office more than four times over and yet no single decision-maker in either department is able to unite our efforts or take a comprehensive overview. We give as much aid to Zambia as we do to Ukraine, though the latter is vital for European security. We give ten times as much aid to Tanzania as we do to the six countries of the Western Balkans, who are acutely vulnerable to Russian meddling. And, regardless of the merits of these decisions, no single department is currently empowered to judge whether they make sense or not: we tolerate an inherent risk of our left and right hands working independently. Faced with this crisis today – and the opportunities that lie ahead – we have a responsibility to ask whether our current arrangements, dating back to 1997, still maximise British influence. Those well-intentioned decisions of 23 years ago were right for their time. They paved the way for Britain to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 percent of national income on aid, a goal that was achieved by the Coalition Government in 2013 and has been maintained ever since - including this year - and which remains our commitment. Yet those judgments date from a relatively benign era when China’s economy was still smaller than Italy’s and the West was buoyed by victory in the Cold War. We must now strengthen our position in an intensely competitive world by making sensible changes, and so I have decided to merge DFID with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to create a new department, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. This will unite our aid with our diplomacy and bring them together in our international effort. DFID has amassed world class expertise and all of its people can take pride in how they have to helped transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world. To select but a few examples, they have striven to protect millions of children across the world from polio – which is now on the verge of global eradication –  and they have paved the way for millions of girls to attend school for the first time in countries like Pakistan, as I have seen for myself. They have done their utmost to ease the suffering in Syria and in Sierra Leone they were central to the defeat of an outbreak of the Ebola virus. All this amounts to the finest demonstration of British values, following in the great tradition of the country that ended the slave trade and resisted totalitarianism. And it is precisely that ambition, vision and expertise that will now be at the heart of a new department, taking forward the work of UK Aid to reduce poverty, and that will remain central to our mission. The Foreign Secretary will be empowered to decide which countries receive – or cease to receive – British aid, while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the National Security Council, which I chair. Those strategies will be implemented on the ground by the relevant UK Ambassador, who will lead all of the Government’s work in the host country. And in this we are following the examples of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all of whom run their development programmes from their foreign ministries. And we will align other British assets overseas, including our trade commissioners, who will come under the authority of the UK ambassador, bringing more coherence to our international presence. Now, amid the pandemic, this House will ask whether this is the right moment to reorganise Whitehall. In reality, this crisis has already imposed fundamental changes on the way that we operate and if there is one further lesson, it is that a whole-of-government approach and getting maximum value for the British taxpayer is just as important abroad as it is at home. This is exactly the moment when we must mobilise every one of our national assets, including our aid budget and expertise, to safeguard British interests and values overseas - and the best possible instrument for doing that will be a new department charged with using all the tools of British influence to seize the opportunities ahead. Mr Speaker, I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Coronavirus press conference 10 June 2020 Good evening,  two weeks ago, I set out the progress we as a country have made against our five tests for adjusting the lockdown, and the measures we could introduce as a result. And today, I want to update you again on those five tests and set out some further changes we can now make. So can I have the first slide please? The five tests are designed, as you know, to ensure that any changes to the lockdown are careful, proportionate, and safe. They combine analysis of the latest data on the spread of the disease with assessments of how well we are placed to meet the operational challenges posed by the virus. We must do everything in our power to avoid a second peak of infection that overwhelms the NHS - because that would lead to more lives lost, more families in mourning, and more disruption to our economy and way of life. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. It’s thanks to the efforts of those working in the NHS that we can still be confident the NHS can cope. On 7 June, 443 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, down from 628 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,431 on 1 April. And on 9 June, 492 patients with coronavirus were in mechanical ventilation beds in the UK, down from 848 two weeks earlier, and down from a peak of 3,301 on 12 April. So that means we are still meeting the first test. Next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. And of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, I am sad to say that 41,128 have now died. That’s an increase of 245 fatalities since yesterday. As measured by a 7-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 200, down from 300 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. So the death rate has continued to fall, and so the second test is still being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. In total, 290,143 people have now tested positive for coronavirus, which is an increase of 1,003 cases since yesterday. The seven day rolling average of new positive cases found through testing is now 1,419, down from 2,416 two weeks ago, and down from a peak of 5,195 in the first week of May. In a moment, Sir Patrick will talk us through SAGE’s latest assessment of the R and other evidence on infection rates. Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied the third test is being met. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. Yesterday 170,379 tests were carried out or posted out across the UK, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. The total now stands at 6,042,622. Tomorrow the Health Secretary will provide an update on how NHS Test and Trace is performing. On PPE, we have secured over 150 deals with new suppliers around the world and procured 2.2 billion items of PPE to be manufactured domestically. Despite the immensely frustrating difficulties we have faced with PPE and testing in the past, this progress means we are now satisfied that the fourth test is being met - though of course we remain vigilant. Next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their advice on the measures I am about to set out – and on this basis I can confirm the Government judges we have met the fifth test. Therefore, the Government is satisfied that all five tests are still being met and we can proceed with the following further adjustments to the lockdown in England. A month ago I set out our roadmap to recovery and that explained the gradual steps we would take to ease the lockdown, as the data and the evidence allows. The measures it contained were all conditional on continued progress in tackling the virus. We are continuing to follow our roadmap, while adjusting our approach as we need to, as we always said we would. Although we are tackling this virus as one United Kingdom, it remains the case that the devolved administrations are responsible for lockdown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it is right that they move at the right pace for them, according to their circumstances. For that reason, the specific measures I am about to set out apply in England only. First, on retail, shops. This has been the most challenging period for shops and high streets in our history. Never before have all shops been ordered to shut in this way. It has now been 82 days since we asked these shops to close their doors and I know the toll this has taken. Which is why I am so pleased that, as the Business Secretary confirmed yesterday, we can now allow all shops to reopen from Monday. It is vital that establishments should ensure they are meeting Covid Secure guidelines before they reopen. That way we can keep staff and customers safe while we get retail going. Second, on social contact. I know how difficult the past months have been for people cut off from their friends and family. Last Monday, we relaxed the rules on meeting outdoors so that groups of up to 6 could gather, provided they are socially distant. We did so in the knowledge that transmission of the virus is much lower outdoors, so we could make this change in a safe way. But there are still too many people, particularly those who live by themselves, who are lonely and struggling with being unable to see friends and family. From this weekend, we will allow single adult households - so adults living alone or single parents with children under 18 - to form a “support bubble” with one other household. All those in a support bubble will be able to act as if they live in the same household - meaning they can spend time together inside each others’ homes and do not need to stay 2 metres apart. I want to stress that support bubbles must be exclusive - meaning you cannot switch the household you are in a bubble with or connect with multiple households. And if any member of the support bubble develops symptoms, all members of the bubble will need to follow the normal advice on household isolation. We are making this change to support those who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures. It is a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions. It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes - that remains against the law. Unfortunately, we cannot advise anyone who is shielding to form a support bubble at this stage, given their particular vulnerability to the virus. However, I want to say I know how hard it is for those of you who are shielding, and we will say more next week about the arrangements that will be in place for you beyond the end of June. Third, on outdoor attractions. Because the risk of transmission is lower outdoors, we can open up some more outdoor attractions for people to enjoy this summer. So from Monday, we will allow outdoor attractions where people can stay in their cars, such as safari parks and drive-in cinemas to open. I am very grateful to the zoo industry for their cooperation and forbearance, and am happy to confirm that they too can reopen from Monday, provided visitor numbers are managed and safeguards put in place. That includes keeping indoor areas such as reptile houses closed and facilitating social distancing. Finally, we will allow places of worship to open for individual prayer this weekend. And I hope that will be of some comfort to those of faith who have been unable to go to their place of worship. As set out in our roadmap, the next set of changes - Step 3 - will not begin until 4 July at the earliest, as the evidence allows. I know that these changes are only incremental and that some of you, many of you, may be hoping and waiting for more. I also know that people will once again find anomalies or apparent anomalies in what people can and cannot do. And as I have said before, I’m afraid that is just inevitable when we are only able to give people a small amount of the freedoms that they usually enjoy. We will continue to remain cautious and measure the effect of the changes that we make. And as I’ve always said, we won’t hesitate to apply the brakes if that is what the situation requires. That has meant moving slower than we would have liked in some areas. It is because the rate of infection is not yet quite low enough, and because we are not able to change our social distancing advice including smaller class sizes in schools, that we are not proceeding with our ambition to bring back all primary pupils at least for some weeks before the summer holidays. Instead we are working with teachers to bring back as many pupils as we can within those smaller class sizes. We do fully intend to bring all children back to school in September, provided the progress we are making continues, which I hope it will. That is our focus and it is consistent with the approach that has been taken by many other countries in Europe. In the meantime we must stick to our roadmap. I urge everyone to continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe. It’s only because of the restraint that everyone, you all have shown so far that we are able to move gradually out of this lockdown. So please, to repeat what you’ve heard so many times before, stay alert, maintain social distancing and keep washing your hands. Help control the virus by getting tested if you have symptoms and isolating if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace. Then, if we all do that together, we will all save lives and begin to rebuild our country. And I’ll now hand over to Sir Patrick. 

Boris:


The death of George Floyd took place thousands of miles away – in another country, under another jurisdiction – and yet we simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered by that spectacle, of a black man losing his life at the hands of the police. In this country and around the world his dying words – I can’t breathe – have awakened an anger and a widespread and incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice, a feeling that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination: in education, in employment, in the application of the criminal law. And we who lead and who govern simply can’t ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality. Yes, I am proud to lead the most ethnically diverse government in the history of this country, with two of the four great offices of state held by a man and a woman of Indian origin; and yes, I am proud of the work I began to lead more than ten years ago to recruit and promote more young black people, in the police and other walks of life. This country has made huge strides. I remember the 1970s, and the horror of the National Front. I truly believe that we are a much, much less racist society than we were, in many ways far happier and better. But we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do – in eradicating prejudice, and creating opportunity, and the government I lead is committed to that effort. And so I say yes, you are right, we are all right, to say Black Lives Matter; and to all those who have chosen to protest peacefully and who have insisted on social distancing – I say, yes of course I hear you, and I understand. But I must also say that we are in a time of national trial, when for months this whole country has come together to fight a deadly plague. After such sacrifice, we cannot now let it get out of control. It is BAME communities who have been at the forefront of the struggle against coronavirus – whether in health care or transport or social care or any of the other essential services that have kept our country going. And it is BAME communities, tragically, that have paid a disproportionate price. So no, I will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing, for the obvious reason that we risk a new infection at a critical time and just as we have made huge progress. And no, I will not support or indulge those who break the law, or attack the police, or desecrate public monuments. We have a democracy in this country. If you want to change the urban landscape, you can stand for election, or vote for someone who will. And so I must say clearly that those who attack public property or the police –who injure the police officers who are trying to keep us all safe – those people will face the full force of the law; not just because of the hurt and damage they are causing, but because of the damage they are doing to the cause they claim to represent. They are hijacking a peaceful protest and undermining it in the eyes of many who might otherwise be sympathetic. And as a society, we can and must do better. This month, on the 22nd of June, we celebrate the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948, and we remember the contribution of the Afro-Caribbean workers – in the NHS and across all public services – who helped to rebuild this country after the war. And today, once again, we face a great task: to relaunch this country after Coronavirus. So let’s work peacefully, lawfully, to defeat racism and discrimination wherever we find it, and let us continue to work together across all the communities of this country, as we put Britain back on its feet. 

Boris:


Coronavirus press conference 13 June 2020 First let me first run you through the latest data on our coronavirus response. 4,786,219 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out or posted out in the UK, including 171,829 tests yesterday. 279,856 people have tested positive, and that’s an increase of 1,871 cases since yesterday. 7,485 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 16% from 8,921 this time last week. And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 39,728 have now died. That’s an increase of 359 fatalities since yesterday and once again we are with their families in mourning. Now that the rate of transmission in the UK has significantly fallen from its peak, we need to take steps to manage the flare-ups and stop the virus re-emerging in the UK. I want to update you on the progress we are making on three fronts to prevent a second wave of infections that could overwhelm the NHS. First, we have set up NHS Test and Trace in order to identify, contain and control the virus in the UK, thereby reducing its spread. As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks. NHS Test and Trace will be vital to controlling the spread of the virus. It’s how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection, and protect our NHS. It does this by identifying anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, and asking them to isolate for 14 days in order to avoid unknowingly infecting others. The system clearly relies on everyone playing their part. So I want to stress again today: we need you to get a test if you have coronavirus symptoms – a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a loss of taste or smell. There is plenty of capacity and everyone with symptoms is eligible, everyone with symptoms, so please order a test from nhs.uk/coronavirus as soon as you develop symptoms. And we need you to isolate yourself if a contact tracer tells you that you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive. NHS Test and Trace started operating a week ago. And already thousands of people are isolating who wouldn’t have been doing so before this service was introduced. They are thereby protecting others and reducing the spread of the virus. So while we are going to all these efforts here in the UK to control the virus, we must also ensure we don’t reimport the virus from abroad. So the second action I want to update you on is the introduction of public health measures at the border. Today the Home Secretary has brought forward the legislation needed to establish the new regime from Monday. And I want to explain the reasons for introducing these measures now. When coronavirus started to spread around the world, first from Wuhan and then from northern Italy and other areas, we introduced enhanced monitoring at the border in an attempt to stop the virus from gaining a foothold in the UK. These measures applied, at various different times, to arrivals from China, Japan, Iran and Italy, and required people with symptoms travelling from those countries to self-isolate for 14 days. However, once community transmission was widespread within the UK, cases from abroad made up a tiny proportion of the total. At the same time you’ll remember that international travel plummeted as countries around the world went into lockdown. So as a result, measures at the border were halted because they made little difference at the time in our fight against the virus. Now that we’re getting the virus under control in the UK, there’s a risk cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases. We therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak. So just as we are asking people already in the UK to isolate for 14 days when contacted by NHS Test and Trace, we’re also asking those arriving from abroad to isolate so that they don’t unknowingly spread the virus. There will be some exemptions for a limited number of people who need to cross the border, such as those engaged directly in the fight against coronavirus or who provide essential services. And we will review how the policy is working after three weeks. And of course we will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection - but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so. The third point I want to make today is we need effective international action to reduce the impact of the virus across the globe. This is the moment really for humanity to unite in the fight against the disease. Health experts have warned that if coronavirus is left to spread in developing countries, that could lead to future waves of infection coming back and reaching the UK. While our amazing NHS has been there for everyone in this country who needs it, many developing countries have healthcare systems which are ill-prepared to manage this pandemic. So to ensure that the world’s poorest countries have the support they need to slow the spread of the virus, tomorrow I will open the Global Vaccine Summit. Hosted by the UK, and will bring together more than 50 countries and leading figures like Bill Gates to raise at least $7.4 billion for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Over the next five years – with the UK’s support as Gavi’s biggest donor – this Vaccine Alliance aims to immunise a further 300 million children in the poorest countries against deadly diseases like polio, typhoid and measles – again saving millions of lives. This support for routine immunisations will shore up poorer countries’ healthcare systems to deal with coronavirus – and so help to stop the global spread and, as I say, prevent a second wave of the virus reaching the UK. This virus has shown how connected we are. We’re fighting an invisible enemy. And no one is safe frankly until we are all safe. And again, of course this is all contingent upon each of us continuing to do our bit. And as I never tire of telling you Let us not forget the basics. Wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds, wash your hands. Do not gather in groups of more than six outside. Always observe social distancing, keeping 2 metres apart from anyone outside your household. And I want to stress one final point which may be relevant today as the weather threatens I think to take a turn for the worse. Some of you may be tempted to move the gatherings you’ve been enjoying outdoors, indoors, out of the rain. I really urge you – don’t do that. We relaxed the rules on meeting outside for a very specific reason – because the evidence shows that the risks of transmission are much lower outdoors, much lower outdoors. And the risks of passing on the virus are significantly higher indoors, which is why gatherings inside other people’s homes are still prohibited. Breaking these rules now could undermine and reverse all the progress that we’ve made together. I have no doubt that that won’t happen, I’ve no doubt that that won’t happen. I think the British public will continue to show the same resolve in fighting the virus as they have throughout the outbreak. We will get through this if we stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so save lives.

This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 28 May 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 28 May 2020. Good evening, Before I set out our next steps in the fight against the coronavirus, let me update you on the latest data: 
3,918,079 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 119,587 tests carried out yesterday;
269,127 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,887 cases since yesterday;
8,560 people are in hospital with coronavirus, down 11% from 9,607 this time last week.
And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 37,837 have now died. That’s an increase of 377 fatalities since yesterday and we are with their friends and family in mourning.

As you know, we have set five tests which must be met before adjusting the lockdown - as set out on the first slide. It is vital that these tests are met before any changes are made, because we must not risk all the hard work and sacrifice of the British people. At all times we are informed by the data and evidence, about the spread of the virus and the impact of the measures taken so far. I will now take you through our latest assessment of progress against each of the five tests. Next slide please. Our first test is to protect the NHS’s ability to cope, so that we are confident that we are able to provide sufficient critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK. At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April. On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April. This significant progress means we are meeting the first test. Can I have the next slide please. Our second test is to see a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19 so we are confident that we have moved beyond the peak. As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April. While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met. Next slide please. Our third test is to receive reliable information, reliable data from SAGE showing that the rate of infection - the number of people catching Covid - is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that’s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May. Based on the various data available, the Government is satisfied that the third test is being met. And in a moment, Sir Patrick will tell us more about other methods of measuring infections, including the R number. Next slide please. Our fourth test is that we must be confident that the range of operational challenges, including on testing capacity and Personal Protective Equipment, are in hand, with supply able to meet future demand. I fully acknowledge the difficulties on testing and PPE that we have faced since the start of the outbreak. It has been immensely frustrating, but we are now making progress. Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day. We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including facemasks, visors, gowns and aprons. We are therefore satisfied that the fourth test is being met and we can start to rebuild stocks - though we recognise there may be some settings that require urgent restocking on occasion. Can I have the next slide please. Our fifth and final test is that we must be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. I am very grateful to the Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief Medical Officer for their assessments of the measures I am about to set out on schools, retail and social contact. Although all parts of the UK are moving in the same direction, it is important to note health is devolved and different parts of the UK are quite properly all moving at different speeds. This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious. It is thanks to the caution we have shown so far that all five tests are being met. That is not my achievement or the government’s achievement - it is your achievement, only possible thanks to your resolve and dedication to our national purpose to overcome this virus. So the result is we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday. Firstly, as I set out on Sunday, we will now reopen schools to more children. Closing schools has deprived children of their education, and as so often it is the most disadvantaged pupils who risk being hardest hit. On Monday we will start to put this right - in a safe way - by reopening nurseries and other early years settings and reception, year one and year six in primary schools. A fortnight later on 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12. Secondly, we will also start to reopen shops as we restart our economy. We will begin, on Monday, with outdoor retail and car showrooms, where social distancing is generally easier. And a fortnight later on 15 June, we intend to reopen other non-essential retail - but only provided the five tests are still being met and shops have been made Covid secure. Lastly, I know the toll that lockdown has taken on families and friends who have been unable to see each other. So from Monday we will allow up to six people to meet outside - provided those from different households continue strictly to observe social distancing rules by staying two metres apart. At the moment, as you know, people can meet in parks but not in private gardens. This was a cautious first step - but we know that there is no difference in the health risk. So we will now allow people to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. These changes mean friends and family can start to meet their loved ones - perhaps seeing both parents at once, or both grandparents at once. I know that for many this will be a long-awaited and joyful moment. But I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with. Minimising contact with others is still the best way to prevent transmission. You should also try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession - so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus. And it remains the case that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden. I should add that, at this stage, I am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so. I want to say to those extremely clinically vulnerable people who are being shielded that I do understand how difficult this has been for you, especially. And I want to thank you for all the efforts you have gone to - because your actions have helped the NHS to cope. We are looking carefully at how we can make your life easier, and how we can better support you, and we want to say more on that soon. I want to reassure everyone that we can make all of the changes I have outlined in a safe way. We know that children, and particularly young children, are much less likely to be seriously affected by the virus. We know that if shops enforce social distancing, as required by our Covid secure guidelines, then the virus is less likely to spread. And crucially, we know that transmission of the virus is far lower outdoors, so we can confidently allow more interaction outside. I understand people will have questions as to how to do all of this safely - and we will publish guidance on these changes to help people, to help you, make the most of them. Now inevitably, there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules. And clearly what we’re proposing is still just a fraction of the social interaction each of us would normally enjoy. I know many of you will find this frustrating - I am sorry about that. But I’m afraid it is unavoidable, given the nature of the invisible enemy we are fighting. It is a complex problem and we are asking for everyone’s patience as we work through it together. We will inevitably not get everything right first time. But I must ask everyone to remember it is that same patience, the hard work, and sacrifices of the British people in lockdown that have got us so far and allow us to make the progress we have. By protecting the NHS, getting us through the peak, and getting the virus under control - we are able to deliver all of the adjustments and easing of restrictions I have set out today. These adjustments are most of those we set out to achieve in step two of our roadmap, and we have also been able to have them in place by June 1 as we had hoped. There is no doubt that we are making progress and I am hopeful that in the coming weeks we may be able to do more. Because obviously while protecting the health and safety of the British public is, and must always be, our number one priority, we must also work to restart our economy and society - so as many people as possible can begin returning to their way of life. But I want to reaffirm that fundamental commitment to the British people that all the steps we have taken, and will take, are conditional. They are conditional on all the data, and all the scientific advice, and it is that scientific advice which will help us to judge what we are doing is safe. And I have to warn you, there will be further local outbreaks. So we will monitor carefully, we will put on the brakes as required, and where necessary, we will re-impose measures. It’s important to be clear about that up front. And as before, we will see how these new changes are working, and look at the R value and the number of new infections before taking any further steps, so we can ensure anything we do does not risk a second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. And yesterday, as I hope you all know, we took a huge step forward that will enable us to keep making progress in returning our lives to as close to normal as possible, while continuing to control the virus and isolate any new outbreaks. And that is through our new NHS Test and Trace programme in England. The Scottish Government has established Test and Protect, and Welsh and Northern Irish schemes will follow next week. And I’ll now show a short video that explains how NHS Test and Trace works in England and what we all need to do to play our part. Now I’ll hand over to Sir Patrick. 

Boris:


Coronavirus press conference 25 May 2020 Good evening and welcome to the Number Ten Coronavirus Press Conference Before I turn to this evening’s announcements, I want to update you on the latest data 

3,532,634 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 73,726 tests carried out yesterday; 

261,184 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 1,625 cases since yesterday; 

8,834 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down (12%) from 10,092 this time last week; 

And sadly, of those who tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,914 have now died. That’s an increase of 121 fatalities since yesterday. This new figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals. And once again my deepest condolences go out to all those who have lost their loved ones before their time. We must not, and will not, forget them. Two weeks ago, I set out our road map for the next phase of our fight against Covid 19 It is a cautious plan, informed by the evidence about what is safe, and conditional upon our continued progress against the virus. And we are making progress. Thanks to this country’s collective efforts, the key indicators are heading in the right direction. The daily number of deaths is down, the number of new cases is down, our survey evidence suggests the infection rate is falling, and the R has not risen above one. So just over 2 weeks ago, we moved to step 1 of our plan, encouraging those who are unable to work from home to go back to work, with new guidelines setting out how workplaces can be made COVID-secure. At the same time, we allowed people to spend more time outdoors and to meet one member of another household outside, provided they remain 2 metres apart. I also said we would be able to move to step 2 of our plan no earlier than Monday 1 June - a week today. We will set out our formal assessment of the 5 tests that we set for adjusting the lockdown later this week, as part of the 3 weekly-review we are legally required to undertake by Thursday. But because of the progress we are making, I can, with confidence, put the British people on notice of the changes we intend to introduce as we move into step 2. And I think it is important to give that notice, so that people have sufficient time to adjust and get ready before those changes come into effect. Yesterday I set out our intention to begin reopening nurseries and particular years in primary schools, reception, year 1, year 6, from 1 June, followed by some contact for those secondary school pupils with exams next year from 15 June. Some contact for years 10 and 12 from 15 June with their teachers. This announcement has given schools, teachers and parents clarity about our intentions, enabling them to prepare in earnest. The Department for Education is now engaging with teaching unions, councils and school leaders to help schools get ready. Today, I want to give the retail sector notice of our intentions to reopen shops, so they too can get ready. So I can announce that it is our intention to allow outdoor markets to reopen from June 1, subject to all premises being made COVID-secure, as well as car showrooms, which often have significant outdoor space and where it is generally easier to apply social distancing. We know that the transmission of the virus is lower outdoors and that it is easier to follow Covid Secure guidelines in open spaces. That means we can also allow outdoor markets to reopen in a safe way that does not risk causing a second wave of the virus. Then, from 15 June, we intend to allow all other  non-essential retail, ranging from department stores to small, independent shops, to reopen. Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the 5 tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are COVID-secure. Today we are publishing new guidance for the retail sector detailing the measures they should take to meet the necessary social distancing and hygiene standards. Shops now have the time to implement this guidance before they reopen. This will ensure there can be no doubt about what steps they should take. While the vast majority of businesses will want to do everything possible to protect their staff and customers, I should add that we will, of course, have the powers we need to enforce compliance where that is required. I want people to be confident they can shop safely, provided they follow the social distancing rules for all premises. The food retail sector has already responded fantastically well, enabling supermarkets to be kept open in a safe way – and we will learn lessons from that experience as we allow other retail to open. These are careful but deliberate steps on the road to rebuilding our country. And we can only take these steps thanks to what we have so far achieved together. We will only be successful if we all remember the basics - so wash your hands, keep social distance, and isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. I will now hand over to Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director of Public Health England, to take us through today’s slides. 

Boris:


Coronavirus press conference 24 May 2020 Good afternoon. I want to begin by answering the big question that people have been asking in the last 48 hours. And that is – is this Government asking you - the people, the public, to do one thing while senior people here in government do something else? Have we been asking you to make sacrifices, to obey social distancing, to stay at home while some people have been basically flouting those rules and endangering lives? And it is because I take this matter so seriously and frankly it is so serious that I can tell you today I have had extensive face to face conversations with Dominic Cummings and I have concluded that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus. And when he had no alternative, I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that. And though there have been many other allegations about what happened when he was in self-isolation and thereafter, some of them palpably false. I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly, and legally, and with integrity, and with the overwhelming aim of stopping the spread of the virus and saving lives. And I stress this fundamental aim, because it is thanks to this country’s collective resolve in achieving that aim that we continue to make progress. So let me give you today’s figures: 
3,458,905 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 110,401 tests carried out yesterday
259,559 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 2,409 cases since yesterday – a smaller increase than we were seeing over the last few weeks
8,951 people are in hospital with COVID-19 in the UK, down 11% from 10,085 this time last week

And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 36,793 have now died. That’s an increase of 118 fatalities since yesterday. And each of those fatalities represents a family in mourning, the grief of friends and relatives. And as we mourn them we resolve again to beat this virus and get our country back on its feet. We can and we will. Two weeks ago I set out the Government’s roadmap to begin easing the measures we put in place to control the spread of coronavirus. I said that we would do so in a safe and controlled way, based on our assessment of progress against the five tests we set for adjusting the lockdown. We’re going to set out that assessment in detail in the coming days, but today I can confirm that I do believe we will be in a position to move to step 2 of our plan. As part of Step 2, we set out plans for a phased reopening of schools. Because the education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health, for their long term future and for social justice And so in line with the approach being taken by other countries, we want to start getting our children back in the classroom in a way that is manageable and as safe as possible. So we said this would begin with early years settings and reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in primary schools. Today I can announce that it is our intention to go ahead with that as planned on June 1st, a week on Monday. We then intend, from June 15th, for secondary schools to provide some contact for Year 10 and Year 12 students to help them prepare for exams next year, with up to a quarter of these students in at any point. By opening schools to more pupils in this limited way, we are taking a deliberately cautious approach. And this comes after a constructive period of consultation with schools, teachers and unions, led by the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. I want to thank all the Education and childcare staff who have stepped up to the challenge and kept schools open throughout this crisis. The Department for Education will engage with teaching unions, local authorities and school leaders in the coming days, giving them an opportunity to ask questions and probe the evidence behind our plans. And the final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. We will of course continue to consider all the evidence (as we said we would do), and will continue to work hard with those bodies over the course of the coming week. However, I think it is important for us to be clear about the Government’s intentions now, so that teachers and parents can plan in earnest for schools to reopen a week on Monday. Now I acknowledge that a 1 June opening may not be possible for all schools, but the Government will continue to support and work with the sector to ensure that any schools experiencing difficulties are able to open more widely as soon as possible. Detailed guidance has been published by the Department for Education on how schools can open in a way which is safe for children, teachers and parents. While of course we recognise that full social distancing may not be possible, especially when teaching young children, our guidance sets out a range of protective measures to keep children and staff safe. This includes: 
reducing the size of classes and keeping children in small groups without mixing with others
staggered break and lunch times, as well as drop offs and pick ups
increasing the frequency of cleaning, reducing the used of shared items and utilising outdoor space

All children and staff, and their families, will have access to testing if they display symptoms. This will enable children and staff to get back to school if they test negative, and if they test positive we will take the appropriate reactive measures. We will continue to work with the sector to support them to prepare for wider opening and ensure all children and young people can continue to receive the best care, education and training possible. We will set out what moving to step 2 means for other areas, such as non-essential retail and more social contacts, over the course of the next week. And let me stress once again: we are making good progress. But that progress is conditional, provisional. We must keep reducing the incidence of this disease. We must keep that R down below 1. And that means we must remember the basics. Wash our hands, keep social distance, isolate if you have symptoms – and get a test. We are beating this thing, but we will beat it all the faster if we stay alert, control the virus and save lives. 

Boris:


Coronavirus press conference 11 May 2020 Good evening and thank you for joining us for this Downing Street press conference. First of all, I want to update you on the latest data in our fight against coronavirus. I can report through the Government’s ongoing testing and monitoring programme that, as of today: 
1,921,770 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 100,490 tests carried out yesterday;
223,060 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 3,877 cases since yesterday;
11,401 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down from 11,768 the previous day.
And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 32,065 have now died. That’s an increase of 210 fatalities since yesterday. This figure includes deaths in all settings not just in hospitals.

Before we begin questions from the public and from the media I just want to remind people of a number of important things I said in my address to the nation last night. First, in order to monitor our progress, we are establishing a new COVID Alert Level System. The COVID Alert Level has five levels, each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. The level will be primarily determined by the R value and the number of coronavirus cases. In turn, that COVID Alert Level will determine the level of social distancing measures in place. The lower the level the fewer the measures; the higher the level the stricter the measures. Throughout the period of lockdown which started on March 23rd we have been at Level 4 – meaning a Covid19 epidemic is in general circulation, and transmission is high or rising exponentially. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifices of the British people in this lockdown, we have helped to bring the R level down and we are now in a position to begin moving to Level 3, in steps. And we have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully modify the measures, gradually ease the lockdown, and begin to allow people to return to their way of life - but crucially while avoiding what would be a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS. After each step we will closely monitor the impact of that step on the R and the number of infections, and all the available data, and we will only take the next step when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so. Step 1 - from this week: 
Those who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.
You can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like.
You can meet one person outside of your household outside (outdoors), provided you stay 2 metres apart. The social distancing measures remain absolutely crucial to us keeping the infection rate and the number of cases down as low as we possibly can.

Step 2 - from June 1, at the earliest, as long as the data allows, we aim to allow: 
Primary schools to reopen for some pupils, in smaller class sizes;
Non-essential retail to start to reopen, when and where it is safe to do so;
Cultural and sporting events to take place behind closed doors, without crowds.

And then Step 3 – no earlier than July 4, and again, only if the data says it safe, we aim to allow: More businesses and premises to open, including potentially those offering personal care such as leisure facilities, public places, and places of worship. Many of these businesses will need to operate in new ways to ensure they are safe, and we will work with these sectors on how to do this. So, given we have taken the first step in carefully adjusting some of the measures today, and therefore our advice to people on what to do, we have also updated our messaging. We are now asking people to Stay Alert, Control the Virus and Save Lives. Yes - staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible. But there are a range of other actions we’re advising people to take as we modify measures. People should Stay Alert, by: 
working from home if you can;
limiting contact with other people;
keeping distance if you go out - 2 metres apart where possible;
washing your hands regularly;
wearing a face covering when you are in enclosed spaces where it’s difficult to be socially distant - for example in some shops and on public transport;
and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate.

Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus by keeping the R down and reducing the number of infections. This is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, with permission, I will make a statement about the next steps in our battle against coronavirus, and how we can, with the utmost caution, gradually begin to rebuild our economy and reopen our society. For the last two months, the British people have faced a grave threat with common sense, compassion and unflinching resolve. We have together observed the toughest restrictions on our freedoms in memory, changing our way of life on a scale unimaginable only months ago. All our efforts have been directed towards protecting our NHS and saving lives. Tragically, many families have lost loved ones before their time and we share their grief. Yet our shared effort has averted a still worse catastrophe, one that could have overwhelmed the NHS and claimed half a million lives. Every day, dedicated doctors, nurses, and social care workers, army medics and more have risked their own lives in the service of others, they have helped to cut the Reproduction rate from between 2.6 and 2.8 in April to between 0.5 and 0.9 today. The number of covid patients in hospital has fallen by over a third since Easter Sunday. Our armed forces joined our NHS to build new hospitals on timetables that were telescoped from years to weeks, almost doubling the number of critical care beds, and ensuring that since the end of March, at least a third have always been available. Our challenge now is to find a way forward that preserves our hard won gains, while easing the burden of the lockdown. And I will be candid with the House: this is a supremely difficult balance to strike. There could be no greater mistake than to jeopardise everything we have striven to achieve by proceeding too far and too fast. We will be driven not by hope or economic revival as an end in itself, but by data, and science and public health. And so the Government is submitting to the House today a plan which is conditional and dependent as always on the common sense and observance of the British people, and on continual re-assessment of the data. That picture varies across the regions and Home Nations of the United Kingdom, requiring a flexible response. Different parts of the UK may need to stay in full lockdown longer but any divergence should only be short-term because as Prime Minister of the UK, I am in no doubt that we must defeat this threat and face the challenge of recovery together. Our progress will depend on meeting five essential tests: protecting the NHS, reducing both the daily death toll and the infection rate in a sustained way,ensuring that testing and PPE can meet future demand - a global problem, but one that we must fix, and avoiding a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS. A new UK-wide Joint Biosecurity Centre will measure our progress with a five-stage Covid Alert System, and the combined effect of our measures so far has been to prevent us from reaching Level Five, a situation that would have seen the NHS overwhelmed, and to hold us at Level Four. Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the British people by following the social distancing rules, we are now in a position where we can move in stages to where I hope the scientific advice will tell us that we are down to Level Three. But this will only happen if everyone continues to play their part, to stay alert and to follow the rules. We must also deal with the epidemic in care homes, where a tragic number of the elderly and vulnerable have been lost and while the situation is thankfully improving, there is a vast amount more to be done. And of course we need a world-leading system for testing and tracking and tracing victims and their contacts so I’m delighted that Baroness Harding, the chair of NHS Improvement, has agreed to take charge of a programme that will ultimately enable us to test hundreds of thousands of people every day. All this means we have begun our descent from the peak of the epidemic, but our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous. So at this stage, we can go no further than to announce the first careful modifications of our measures, Step 1 in moving towards Covid Alert Level 3, a shift in emphasis that we can begin this week. Anyone who cannot work from home should be actively encouraged to go to work. And sectors that are allowed to be open should indeed be open, but subject to social distancing. These include food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, scientific research. And to support this, to explain this again, we are publishing guidance for businesses on how to make these workplaces safe. Covid secure. People who are able to work from home, as we’ve continually said, should continue to do so, and people who cannot work from home should talk to their employers about returning this week and the difficulties they may or may not have. Anyone with covid symptoms obviously – or in a household where someone else has symptoms – should self-isolate. We want everyone travelling to work to be safe, so people should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible because we must maintain social distancing which will inevitably limit capacity. Instead people should drive or better still walk or cycle. With more activity outside our homes, we would now advise people to wear a cloth face covering in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible, and you are more likely to come in contact with people you do not normally meet. The reason is face coverings can help to protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease, particularly if you have coronavirus like symptoms. But this does not mean – and I must stress this – this does not mean wearing medical face masks, 2R or FFP3, which must be reserved for people who need them. We have all lived so far with onerous restrictions Mr Speaker on outdoor spaces and exercise, and this is where my honourable friend interjects as I know he’s a keen swimmer and unfortunately we can’t do anything for swimming pools but we can do something for lakes and the sea. and this is where we can go significantly further because there is a lower risk from outdoors than indoors. So from Wednesday there will be no limits on the frequency of outdoor exercise people can take. You can now walk, sit and rest in parks, you can play sports and exercise, and you can do all these things with members of your own household, or with one other person from another household, provided you observe social distancing and remain 2 metres apart from them. And I do hope that’s clear Mr Speaker. I’m conscious people want to come back and ask questions in more detail and I’d be very happy to answer. We shall increase the fines for the small minority who break the rules, starting at £100 but doubling with each infringement up to £3,600. You can drive as far as you like to reach an outdoor space, subject to the same rules and the laws and guidance of the Devolved Administrations. I am sorry to say however, Mr Speaker, that we shall continue to ask those who are clinically vulnerable – including pregnant women and people over 70, or those with pre-existing chronic conditions – to take particular care to minimise contact with those outside their households. And we must continue to shield people who are extremely vulnerable. They should, I am afraid, remain at home and avoid any direct contact with others. I know that easing restrictions for the many will only increase the anguish of those who must remain shielded, so the Government will look at every possible way of supporting the most vulnerable. Mr Speaker, all of our precautions will count for little if our country is re-infected from overseas, so I give notice that we shall introduce new restrictions at the UK border, requiring 14 days of self-isolation for international arrivals, while respecting our common travel area with Ireland. Every day, we shall monitor our progress, and if we stay on the downward slope, and the R remains below 1, then – and only then – will it become safe to go further, and move to the second step. This will not happen until 1st June at the earliest, but we may then be in a position to start the phased reopening of shops; to return children to early years’ settings, including nurseries and childminders; to return primary schools in stages, giving priority to the youngest children in reception and year 1, and those in year 6 preparing for secondary school; and to enable secondary school pupils facing exams next year to get at least some time with their teachers. Our ambition – and I stress this is conditional Mr Speaker –is for all primary school pupils to return to the classroom for a month before the summer break. To those ends, we are publishing guidance on how schools might reopen safely. Step two could also include allowing cultural and sporting events behind closed doors for broadcast, which I think would provide a much needed boost to national morale. But nothing can substitute for human contact and so the Government has asked SAGE when and how we could safely allow people to expand their household group to include one other household, on a strictly reciprocal basis. Finally, and no earlier than July, we may be able to move to step three – if and only if supported by the data, and the best scientific advice. We would then aim to reopen some remaining businesses, including potentially hospitality, cinemas and hairdressers as well as places of worship and leisure facilities. And this will depend on maintaining social distancing and new ways of providing services, so we will phase and pilot any re-openings to ensure public safety. And I must be clear again: if the data goes the wrong way, if the Alert Level begins to rise, we will have no hesitation in putting on the brakes, delaying or reintroducing measures – locally, regionally or nationally. Mr Speaker, our struggle against this virus has placed our country under the kind of strain that will be remembered for generations. But so too has the response of the British people, from dedicated shopworkers keeping our supermarkets open, and ingenious teachers finding new ways of inspiring their pupils, to the kindness of millions who have checked on their neighbours, delivered food for the elderly, or raised astonishing amounts for charity. In these and in so many other ways, we are seeing the indomitable spirit of Britain And Mr speaker let me summarise by saying that people should Stay Alert by working from home if you possibly can, by limiting contact with other people, by keeping your distance 2 metres apart where possible - by washing your hands regularly, and if you or anyone in your household has symptoms, you all need to self-isolate. Because if everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control the virus, keep the rate of infection down and the keep number of infections down. And this Mr Speaker is how we can continue to save lives, and livelihoods, as we begin to recover from coronavirus, and I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson has addressed the nation on coronavirus. It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom – your freedom – of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it’s the only way to defeat the coronavirus - the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime. And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense. And though we grieve for all those we have lost. It is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know - you know - that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants. And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children. So I want to provide tonight - for you - the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in Parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening. I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates. And though it is right to be flexible in our response. I believe that as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress could. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection. We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago. And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels. Level One means the disease is no longer present in the UK and Level Five is the most critical – the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. Over the period of the lockdown we have been in Level Four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that – all told - we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing – but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn’t seen this disease before, and we didn’t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups – in your area – as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 – but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given. We have by no means fulfilled all of them. And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them. And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further. In step two – at the earliest by June 1 – after half term – we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.
We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health. And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.
It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down. And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission significantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes. We have been through the initial peak – but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already. The patience and common sense you have shown. The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can. The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers. The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease. Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more. The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine. When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country. And that have helped to get us through this first phase. I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. And if we can’t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won’t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right. We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.
More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing. But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 30 April 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 30 April 2020. Good afternoon, welcome everyone again to this Number Ten press conference where I am joined by Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance our Chief Scientific Advisor And I am sorry not to have been part of this trio for so long I want to thank everybody who has been doing such a good job in my absence and I want to thank the NHS for so much Including getting me back here and I might add for a much happier hospital visit yesterday In a few minutes I am going to hand over to Patrick to update you on the epidemic But first I am going to set out today’s latest data 901,905 tests for coronavirus have now been carried out in the UK, including 81,611 tests yesterday 171,253 people have tested positive, that’s an increase of 6,032 cases since yesterday 15,043 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, compared to 15,359 people yesterday And sadly, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 26,711 have now died. That’s an increase of 674 fatalities since yesterday across all settings. This figure of course includes deaths not just in hospitals. Across this country, therefore, families every day are continuing to lose loved ones before their time We grieve for them and with them But as we grieve we are strengthened in our resolve to defeat this virus To get this whole country back to health, back on its feet And we are determined urgently and in particular to overcome those challenges that in the last few weeks have been so knotty and so infuriating I’m not going to minimise the logistical problems we have faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people at the right time, both in the NHS and in care homes Or the frustrations that we have experienced in expanding the numbers of tests But what I can tell you is that everyone responsible for tackling these problems whether in Government or the NHS, or Public Health England, local authorities We are throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day To get it right – and we will get it right and we are making huge progress And I will not underrate the work and the achievement of those who are dealing with global shortages, in a global pandemic They are rising to a challenge we have never seen in our lifetimes And the same can be said of the entire people of this country
Staying in enforced confinement Not seeing family, not seeing friends or grandchildren Worrying about their jobs and the future And so my message to everyone again today is your effort and your sacrifice is working and has been proved to work Today the number of Covid hospital admissions is falling The number of patients in ICU is falling We have so far succeeded in the first and most important task we set ourselves as a nation To avoid the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world Because at no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed No patient went without a ventilator No patient was deprived of intensive care We have five of the seven projected Nightingale wards And it is thanks to that massive collective effort to shield the NHS that we avoided an uncontrollable and catastrophic epidemic where the reasonable worst case scenario was 500,000 deaths And so I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope And we have so many reasons to be hopeful for the long term The UK is leading international efforts to find a vaccine Today Oxford university has announced a partnership with Astrazeneca to develop what they believe could soon be a means of inoculating ourselves against this disease But until this day comes – and I am afraid we cannot say exactly when it may be We will have to beat this disease by our growing resolve and ingenuity So I will be setting out a comprehensive plan next week To explain how we can get our economy moving, one, How we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, second, and third
how we can travel to work and how we can make life in the workplace safer And in short how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time re-start the economy. A huge amount of work has been going on on that that plan and as we produce it we are being guided by the science, and we will try to build the maximum political consensus as we produce it across all parties and across the UK But there will be five key tests that we must satisfy before we can put that plan into action We must be sure that we can continue to protect the NHS and its ability to cope We must see a sustained fall in deaths We must be sure that the infection rate is falling We must overcome the operational and logistical challenges on testing and PPE Fifth, and this is the most important, we must all make sure that the measures we take do not risk a second spike that would overwhelm the NHS We have come through the peak Or rather we’ve come under what could have been a vast peak as though we’ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one And before I hand over to Patrick I am going to ask for a short explanatory clip about the one And before we come to that clip, let me just emphasise that keeping the R down is going to be absolutely vital to our recovery, keeping the reproduction rate of the disease down, and we can only do it by our collective discipline and working together I know we can do it, because we did it, we’ve shown we can do it, in phase one of this disease This country came together in a way few of us have seen in our lifetimes To protect the NHS and to save lives and that’s why I am absolutely convinced we can do it in phase two as well Can we play the video now. 

Boris:


I am sorry I have been away from my desk for much longer than I would have liked and I want to thank everybody who has stepped up in particular the First Secretary of State Dominic Raab who has done a terrific job but once again I want to thank you the people of this country for the sheer grit and guts you have shown and are continuing to show every day I know that this virus brings new sadness and mourning to households across the land and it is still true that this is the biggest single challenge this country has faced since the war and I in no way minimise the continuing problems we face and yet it is also true that we are making progress with fewer hospital admissions fewer covid patients in ICU and real signs now that we are passing through the peak and thanks to your forbearance, your good sense, your altruism, your spirit of community thanks to our collective national resolve we are on the brink of achieving that first clear mission to prevent our national health service from being overwhelmed in a way that tragically we have seen elsewhere and that is how and why we are now beginning to turn the tide If this virus were a physical assailant an unexpected and invisible mugger which I can tell you from personal experience it is then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity this is the moment when we can press home our advantage it is also the moment of maximum risk because I know that there will be many people looking now at our apparent success and beginning to wonder whether now is the time to go easy on those social distancing measures and I know how hard and how stressful it has been to give up even temporarily those ancient and basic freedoms not seeing friends, not seeing loved ones working from home, managing the kids worrying about your job and your firm so let me say directly also to British business to the shopkeepers, to the entrepreneurs, to the hospitality sector to everyone on whom our economy depends I understand your impatience I share your anxiety And I know that without our private sector without the drive and commitment of the wealth creators of this country there will be no economy to speak of there will be no cash to pay for our public services no way of funding our NHS and yes I can see the long term consequences of lock down as clearly as anyone and so yes I entirely share your urgency it’s the government’s urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike the risk of losing control of that virus and letting the reproduction rate go back over one because that would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we would be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country and the whole economy and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage and so I know it is tough and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS and I ask you to contain your impatience because I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict and in spite of all the suffering we have so nearly succeeded we defied so many predictions we did not run out of ventilators or ICU beds we did not allow our NHS to collapse and on the contrary we have so far collectively shielded our NHS so that our incredible doctors and  nurses and healthcare staff have been able to shield all of us from an outbreak that would have been far worse and we collectively flattened the peak and so when we are sure that this first phase is over and that we are meeting our five tests deaths falling NHS protected rate of infection down really sorting out the challenges of testing and PPE avoiding a second peak then that will be the time to move on to the second phase in which we continue to suppress the disease and keep the reproduction rate, the r rate, down, but begin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions and one by one to fire up the engines of this vast UK economy and in that process difficult judgments will be made and we simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made though clearly the government will be saying much more about this in the coming days and I want to serve notice now that these decisions will be taken with the maximum possible transparency and I want to share all our working and our thinking, my thinking, with you the British people and of course, we will be relying as ever on the science to inform us as we have from the beginning but we will also be reaching out to build the biggest possible consensus across business, across industry, across all parts of our United Kingdom across party lines bringing in opposition parties as far as we possibly can because I think that is no less than what the British people would expect and I can tell you now that preparations are under way and have been for weeks to allow us to win phase two of this fight as I believe we are now on track to prevail in phase one and so I say to you finally if you can keep going in the way that you have kept going so far if you can help protect our NHS to save lives and if we as a country can show the same spirit of optimism and energy shown by Captain Tom Moore who turns 100 this week if we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together we will come through this all the faster and the United Kingdom will emerge stronger than ever before 

Boris:


This transcript is for the coronavirus statement delivered on 25 March 2020:
Coronavirus press conference 25 March 2020. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for today’s daily briefing on coronavirus. I would like to update you all on the government’s plan to defeat the virus and on the latest developments. I am joined once again by our Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance. From the very beginning of this crisis I have followed the advice of our world-leading scientists. To defeat coronavirus by taking the right measures at the right time. What everyone needs to recognise is that our NHS – like any world-class health service – has only limited numbers of doctors, nurses and specialist equipment. So, the more people who become sick at any one time, the harder it is for the NHS to cope. And so it is vital to delay the spread of the disease and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time. That is why we have given the clear instruction that people must stay at home – unless they have one of the reasons we have set out. And, with your help we will slow the spread of the disease. I want to thank everyone who has been following the clear rules that we set out on Monday. And I want to thank everyone in the NHS, the front line of the fight against coronavirus. And of course all our public services. Our teachers and our school staff, the transport workers, police officers, And everyone who is keeping this country going. But I also want to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS. When we launched the appeal last night we hoped to get 250,000 over a few days. But I can tell you that in just 24 hours 405,000 people have responded to the call. They will be driving medicines from pharmacies to patients. They will be bringing patients home from hospital. Very importantly they’ll be making regular phone calls to check on and support people who are staying on their own at home. And they will be absolutely crucial in the fight against this virus. That is already – in one day – as many volunteers as the population of Coventry. And so, to all of you, and to all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service. I say thank you on behalf of the entire country. Now I want to take some questions but finally I want to remind everyone of our core policy: Stay at home Protect the NHS And save lives. 

Boris:


Good afternoon everyone Thank you for coming, and thank you to Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, and Dr Jenny Harries, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer. I want again to thank everyone in the country today for the huge effort that we are collectively making. I want to thank the amazing workers in the NHS, everybody working in social care, in every sector, in food distribution, transport, you name it – absolutely everyone who is keeping this country going today. And I want to thank everyone who is being forced to do something differently today. Everyone who didn’t visit their mum for Mother’s Day but Facetimed them, Skyped them, rang them instead. Thank you for your restraint and for what you did. Everyone who was forced to close a pub or a restaurant or a gym or any other business that could have done fantastic businesses on a great day like this. Thank you for your sacrifice, I know how tough it must be. And I can tell you again that this government will be standing behind you – behind British business, behind British workers, employees, self-employed – throughout this crisis. And the reason we are taking these unprecedented steps to prop up businesses, support businesses and support our economy and these preventative measures is because we have to slow the spread of the disease and to save thousands of lives. Today we have come to the stage of our plan that I advertised at the outset, when we first set out the plan of the UK government. When we have to take special steps to protect the particularly vulnerable. I said the moment would come where we needed to shield those with serious conditions. There are probably about 1.5 million in all. And in a minute Robert Jenrick will set out the plan in detail. But this shielding will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life. That is what we want to do. Also to reduce infection and to slow the spread of the disease. We have to do more to make sure that the existing measures that we are taking are having the effect that we want. So it is crucial that people understand tomorrow that the schools are closed. And tomorrow you should not send your child to school unless you have been identified as a key worker. And more generally in the view of the way people have responded over the last few days to the measures we have set out I want to say a bit more about how we interact outdoors. Of course I want people to be able to go to the parks and open spaces and to enjoy themselves – it is crucial for health and mental and physical wellbeing. But please follow the advice and don’t think that fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity. You have to stay two metres apart; you have to follow the social distancing advice. And even if you think you are personally invulnerable, there are plenty of people you can infect and whose lives will then be put at risk. And I say this now – on Sunday evening – take this advice seriously, follow it, because it is absolutely crucial. And as I have said throughout this process we will keep the implementation of these measures under constant review and, yes of course, we will bring forward further measures if we think that is necessary. Always remember that in following this advice- and I know how difficult that is – that each and every one of us. You are doing your bit in following this advice to slow the spread of this disease. The more we collectively slow the spread, the more time we give the NHS to prepare, the more lives we will save, the faster we will get through this. And always remember – we will get through this, and we will beat it together. Next Robert Jenrick to outline the shielding measures. 

Boris:


Good afternoon and thank you for coming again, Today I am joined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Jennie Harries deputy chief medical officer. Yesterday I set out the ambition of this government to turn the tide against coronavirus within 3 months.
And I want to repeat that determination today. We are going to do it with testing. We are going to do it with new medicines, and with new digital technology that will help us to see the disease as it is transmitted, and thereby, by eliminating it, to stamp it out. And above all, now we are going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort to slow the spread by reducing unnecessary social contact. And I want to thank everyone for following the guidance we issued on Monday: to stay at home for 7 days if you think you have the symptoms, for 14 days if anyone in your household has either of the symptoms – a new continuous cough or a high temperature. To avoid pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants. To work from home if at all possible. Keep washing your hands. I know it has been tough. I know it has been inconvenient. But these actions that we’re all taking together are already helping to take the strain off our NHS. Bit by bit, day by day, by your actions, your restraint and your sacrifice, we are putting this country in a better and stronger position, where we will be able to save literally thousands of lives, of people of all ages, people who don’t deserve to die now. People whose lives can, must, and will be saved. And as we take these actions together and as we make these sacrifices, we can see the impact on the real economy. Already, fantastic British companies, already under huge strain, big and small. Workers who are finding that their jobs are under threat or are going, through no fault of their own.
And to all of them, we in government say: We will stand by you. And I say that to companies, remember our joint objective: to beat this virus. And we will do everything in our power to help. And in just a minute, Rishi is going to explain how we are going to help workers of all kinds to get through this crisis, Supporting you directly in a way that Government has never been done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business. And of course these measures are intended to be temporary and of course I am confident that, in time, the UK economy is going to bounce back. Of course it is. But I must be absolutely clear with you: the speed of that eventual recovery depends entirely on our ability, our collective ability, to get on top of the virus now. And that means we have to take the next steps, on scientific advice and following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday which you will remember. And of course people have already made a huge effort to comply with those measures for avoiding unnecessary social contact. But we need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us. And so following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations, We are collectively telling, telling cafes, pubs, bars, restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow. Though to be clear, they can continue to provide take-out services. We’re also telling nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close on the same timescale. Now, these are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad things is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart. And I want to stress that we will review the situation each month, to see if we can relax any of these measures. And listening to what I have just said, some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight. But please don’t. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others So that’s why, as far as possible, we want you to stay at home, that’s how we can protect our NHS and save lives. To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people. And I also know much, right now, workers and business deserve the financial reassurance we are giving them. But we will get through this. We will get through it together, and we will beat this virus. And to ram that point home: the more effectively we follow the advice that we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full. 

Boris:


I want to begin by thanking everyone, by thanking you, in the media, and also thanking everyone for the huge efforts that the country is making to comply with the advice that we’ve been given And we’re asking such a huge amount, asking students to put their education on hold, we’re asking people not to socialise in the normal way And already we can see the impact that this is having on the UK economy and on business, on great, great companies And so it’s vital that we in Government stand behind them when what we are asking everyone to do is so crucial for saving literally thousands of lives by defeating this virus And I am conscious as the days have gone by that people will want to know how long we are expecting them to keep it up And I wanted to try to say something today about how I see the timescale of this campaign and where we’re going and what we need to do I do think, looking at it all, that we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks And I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing in this country but only if we take the steps, we all take the steps we have outlined, And that is vital because that is how we are going to reduce the peak and once we’ve achieved that, and I think that we will, if take the steps that I have said, then the scientific progress that we’re making will really start to come into play and I wanted to discuss a little bit of that this afternoon with you because we are rapidly becoming so much better at understanding the genomics at the heart of this virus, a lot of that is going on in this country, we’re getting better at understanding the medicines that may treat and cure it And today we have put the first British corona patient into a randomised trial for drugs that may treat the disease UK experts and scientists expect to start trials for the first vaccine within a month And above all we are getting better at testing This crisis is so difficult because the enemy is invisible And the answer is to remove the cloak of invisibility And to identify the virus, and to be able to know which of us, is carrying it or who has actually had it and now got over it And to give you an idea of what is coming down the track We are in negotiations today to buy a so called antibody test As simple as a pregnancy test That could tell whether you have had the disease And it’s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable because obviously it has the potential to be a total gamechanger Because once you know that you have had it, you know that you are likely to be less vulnerable, you’re less likely to pass it on, and you can go back to work And of course by the same token we are massively increasing the testing to see whether you have it now And ramping up daily testing from 5000 a day to 10,000 to 25,000 and then up to 250,000 And that knowledge of where the virus is, will make a huge difference to our management of the disease and our ability to reduce disruption and economic difficulties And I wanted to set that out because this is rapidly coming down the track as I say, but it will take time to come on stream And that is why in the meantime, to get back to a theme that you know I’m going to repeat, it is absolutely vital that we follow the advice that we’ve been hearing over the last few days, The announcements we’ve already made about staying at home if you have the symptoms, if your family has the symptoms, about avoiding unnecessary contact Avoiding gatherings where you may pick up the disease pubs, bars, restaurants Please, please follow all that advice scrupulously Work from home if you possibly can Wash your hands, wash your hands And it’s by this combination of ruthless, determined, collective action and scientific progress that we’re already seeing that we will succeed And I know how difficult it may be, or it may seem right now, but if we do this together we will save, as I say, many many thousands of lives and to everybody in the UK, business world, everybody who is worried about their jobs, and everybody who faces difficulties because of the advice that we are giving, I say to business, stand by your employees, stand by your workers because we will stand by you And you’ll be hearing more about that in the course of the next day or so And that is how, by a mixture of determined, collective action and scientific progress, I have absolutely no doubt that we will turn the tide of this disease and beat it together. 

Boris:


Good afternoon. And thanks for coming or for indeed tuning in to these daily updates. I want to introduce, I’m sure you know Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, and you know Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Advisor. I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that. I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough. Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands. And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day. A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others. We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge. And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice. And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off.  And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic. And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable. And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review. So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools. So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils. The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that. But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work. And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups. So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children. This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning. So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. 
And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career. Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work. And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday. I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures. I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all. By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science. We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease. But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead. And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together. 

Boris:


I want to go through our overall plan for beating this new coronavirus. First, we must stop the disease spreading to a point where it overwhelms our NHS. Every country in the world has the same problem. This is a disease that is so dangerous and so infectious that without drastic measures to check its progress it would overwhelm any health system in the world. I have used the Italian health system, it is excellent, and the problem is not the health system, it’s the numbers of sufferance. That is why we announced the steps yesterday that we did – advising against all unnecessary contact – steps that are unprecedented since World War 2. They will have an effect on the spread of the disease. The shielding of vulnerable groups will also reduce suffering, and I want to thank everybody at this stage for what we’re all doing to follow this advice. I stress that although the measures announced are already extreme, we may well have to go further and faster in the coming days to protect lives and the NHS. Secondly, we are doing all we can and as quickly as we can to increase the capacity of the NHS. That means more testing, more beds, more ventilators and more trained staff. It means greater support for NHS and other staff. And it means much better data and much better technology. Third, we must do all we can to boost science and research. We must study this disease, test drugs that already exist and have been through medical trials to see what helps treat severe cases, and search for a vaccine.
Fourth, we must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. That’s the main purpose of this press conference this afternoon. We must support millions of businesses and tens of millions of families and individuals through the coming months.  And to do that the government machine must and will respond with a profound sense of urgency. Thousands of brilliant officials are already working round the clock but we must do more and faster. The Chancellor will be saying much more about this in a moment, with further announcements in the coming days. Fifth, we will need to strengthen other public services that will be under great pressure from the direct and indirect effects of the disease, such as the effects of staff shortages, and from the economic pressures. All institutions will be under great pressure and we will therefore invest hugely in the people that we all rely on, and again I want to thank all our public servants for what they are already doing. Ultimately, to beat this crisis we will need a combination of better science, technology, medicine, data, government operations, economic support, learning from other countries and social support. As time goes on we will learn more and more about the disease and the effects of our actions. And while we need national unity, we also need international cooperation. And although we now need to impose physical distance between ourselves, we must at the same time have closer social support for each other. Yes this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable – and we know how to beat it and we know that if as a country we follow the scientific advice that is now being given we know that we will beat it. And however tough the months ahead we have the resolve and the resources to win the fight. And, to repeat, this government will do whatever it takes. I will now handover for more on that to Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. 

Boris:


Good afternoon everybody, thank you very much for coming. I wanted to bring everyone up to date with the national fight back against the new coronavirus and the decisions that we’ve just taken in COBR for the whole of the UK. As we said last week, our objective is to delay and flatten the peak of the epidemic by bringing forward the right measures at the right time, so that we minimise suffering and save lives. And everything we do is based scrupulously on the best scientific advice. Last week we asked everyone to stay at home if you had one of two key symptoms: a high temperature or a new and continuous cough. Today, we need to go further, because according to SAGE [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] it looks as though we’re now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve. And without drastic action, cases could double every 5 or 6 days. So, first, we need to ask you to ensure that if you or anyone in your household has one of those two symptoms, then you should stay at home for fourteen days. That means that if possible you should not go out even to buy food or essentials, other than for exercise, and in that case at a safe distance from others. If necessary, you should ask for help from others for your daily necessities. And if that is not possible, then you should do what you can to limit your social contact when you leave the house to get supplies. And even if you don’t have symptoms and if no one in your household has symptoms, there is more that we need you to do now. So, second, now is the time for everyone to stop non-essential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues. It goes without saying, we should all only use the NHS when we really need to. And please go online rather than ringing NHS 111. Now, this advice about avoiding all unnecessary social contact, is particularly important for people over 70, for pregnant women and for those with some health conditions. And if you ask, why are we doing this now, why now, why not earlier, or later? Why bring in this very draconian measure? The answer is that we are asking people to do something that is difficult and disruptive of their lives. And the right moment, as we’ve always said, is to do it when it is most effective, when we think it can make the biggest difference to slowing the spread of the disease, reducing the number of victims, reducing the number of fatalities. And as we take these steps we should be focusing on the most vulnerable. So third, in a few days’ time – by this coming weekend – it will be necessary to go further and to ensure that those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks. And again the reason for doing this in the next few days, rather than earlier or later, is that this is going to be very disruptive for people who have such conditions, and difficult for them, but, I believe, it’s now necessary. And we want to ensure that this period of shielding, this period of maximum protection coincides with the peak of the disease. And it’s now clear that the peak of the epidemic is coming faster in some parts of the country than in others. And it looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead. So, to relieve the pressure on the London health system and to slow the spread in London, it’s important that Londoners now pay special attention to what we are saying about avoiding non-essential contact, and to take particularly seriously the advice about working from home, and avoiding confined spaces such as pubs and restaurants. Lastly, it remains true as we have said in the last few weeks that risks of transmission of the disease at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low. But obviously, logically as we advise against unnecessary social contact of all kinds, it is right that we should extend this advice to mass gatherings as well. And so we’ve also got to ensure that we have the critical workers we need, that might otherwise be deployed at those gatherings, to deal with this emergency. So from tomorrow, we will no longer be supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers in the way that we normally do. So mass gatherings, we are now moving emphatically away from. And I know that many people – including millions of fit and active people over 70 – may feel, listening to what I have just said, that there is something excessive about these measures. But I have to say, I believe that they are overwhelmingly worth it to slow the spread of the disease, to reduce the peak, to save life, minimise suffering and to give our NHS the chance to cope. Over the last few days, I have been comparing notes and talking to leaders around the world and I can tell you that the UK is now leading a growing global campaign amongst all our friends and allies, whether in the G7, the G20, the UN, the IMF – all those bodies in which we play a significant role. We’re leading a campaign to fight back against this disease. To keep the economy growing, to make sure that humanity has access to the drugs and the treatments that we all need, and the UK is also at the front of the effort to back business, to back our economy, to make sure that we get through it. I know that today we are asking a lot of everybody. It is far more now than just washing your hands - though clearly washing your hands remains important. But I can tell you that across this country, people and businesses in my experience are responding with amazing energy and creativity to the challenge that we face, and I want to thank everybody for the part that you are playing and are going to play. 

Boris:


Good afternoon everybody and thank you very much for coming. I’ve just chaired a meeting of the government’s emergency committee including ministers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And it’s clear that coronavirus, COVID-19, continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We’ve done what can be done to contain this disease and this has bought us valuable time. But it is now a global pandemic. And the number of cases will rise sharply and indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. I’ve got to be clear, we’ve all got to be clear, that this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Owing to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous. And it’s going to spread further and I must level with you, level with the British public, many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. And the Chief Scientific Adviser will set out the best information we have on that in a moment. But as we’ve said over the last few weeks, we have a clear plan that we are now working through. And we are now moving to the next phase in that plan. Because this is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we’ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope. The Chief Medical Officer will set out our lines of defence. We have to deploy these at the right time to maximise their effect. The most important task will be to protect our elderly and most vulnerable people during the peak weeks when there is the maximum risk of exposure to the disease and when the NHS will be under the most pressure. So the most dangerous period is not now but some weeks away depending on how fast it spreads. Today therefore we are moving forward with our plan. From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild – either a new continuous cough or a high temperature – then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. At some point in the next few weeks, we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms, we will be asking everyone in the household to stay at home. We are not introducing this yet for reasons Sir Patrick will explain, but I want to signal now that this is coming down the track. We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. The scientific advice as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread. But there is also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. So we’re discussing these issues with colleagues in all parts of the United Kingdom and will have more to say shortly about the timing of further action in that respect. At all stages, we have been guided by the science, and we will do the right thing at the right time. We are not - repeat not - closing schools now. The scientific advice is that this could do more harm than good at this time. But we are of course keeping this under review and this again may change as the disease spreads. Schools should only close if they are specifically advised to do so. And that remains our advice. There is no escaping the reality that these measures will cause severe disruption across our country for many months. The best scientific advice is that this will help us slow the disease and save lives. There will be detailed information available on the NHS website and from 111 online. But I want to stress something that is very important in the wake of what we’re saying this afternoon – I urge people, who think in view of what we’re saying about their potential symptoms that they should stay at home, not to call 111 but to use the internet for information if they can. I also want at this stage to speak directly to older people. Because this disease is particularly dangerous for you, for older people, even though the vast majority this will be a mild to moderate illness, I know that many people will be very worried. And I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives, the more vulnerable members of their family, our neighbours, and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months. We’re going to need to mobilise millions of people to help and support each other. And I just want to you to know that the government will do all we can to help you and your family during this period. We’re not just going to be as you saw yesterday supporting the economy during this period, we will be providing money and many other forms of support, and helping communities to support each other. And as we have done over the last few weeks, we will continue to provide, as soon as we have it, as much clear scientific and medical information as we can. So I’d like to end by repeating the two important messages, with which you will have become familiar – it is still vital, perhaps more vital than ever – that we remember to wash our hands. And lastly of course even if things seem tough now, just to remember, that we will get through this, this country will get through this epidemic, just as it has got through many tougher experiences before if we look out for each other and commit wholeheartedly to a full national effort. 

Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 
The attack against the Taji military base in Iraq is deplorable. Our servicemen and women work tirelessly every day to uphold security and stability in the region – their presence makes us all safer. The Foreign Secretary has spoken to the US Secretary of State and we will continue to liaise with our international partners to fully understand the details of this abhorrent attack. 


Boris:


This morning I chaired a meeting of the government’s COBR emergency committee on the Coronavirus outbreak. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland also attended and we agreed to continue to work closely in the weeks and months ahead. We received a detailed briefing from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Advisor. And again I repeat my gratitude to both Chris and to Patrick. There have now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK, and our deepest sympathies are obviously with their friends and families. Our action plan as you know sets out the four phases of our approach to tackling the virus: Contain, Delay, Research, and Mitigate. We remain in the Contain phase of the outbreak, but watching what is happening around the world, our scientists think containment is extremely unlikely to work on its own, and that is why we are making extensive preparations for a move to the delay phase. We are preparing various actions to slow the spread of this disease in order to reduce the strain it places on the NHS. The more we can delay the peak of the spread to the summer, the better the NHS will be able to manage. Patrick and Chris will give you some more detailed information on the latest advice we are giving the public today - and how we expect that advice to change as the outbreak develops. As things stand I’m afraid it bears repeating that the best thing we can all do is wash our hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. We will also take questions, because I know there are lots of things the public want to hear from our advisors about. But before that I want to stress the following things: First, we are doing everything we can to combat this outbreak, based on the very latest scientific and medical advice. Second, we have a truly brilliant NHS, where staff have responded with all the determination, compassion and skill that makes their service so revered across the world. And they will continue to have this government’s full support, my support, in tackling this virus on the frontline. Third, we will set out further steps in the days and weeks ahead to help people protect themselves, their family and in particular the elderly and vulnerable. And finally, while it is absolutely critical, it’s absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time, based on the latest and best evidence. So we must not do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out to be counterproductive. There is no hiding from the fact that the coronavirus outbreak will present significant challenges for the UK, just as it does in other countries. But if we continue to look out for one another, to pull together in a united and national effort, I have no doubt that we can and will rise to that challenge. And I’m now going to ask Patrick and then Chris to give their own perspective on where we are. 

Boris:


Good morning and thank you for coming along, and I am very glad to be joined this morning by the government’s Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Advisor. Today we have published the Coronavirus Action Plan setting out how all four parts of the UK will take all necessary and reasonable steps to tackle this outbreak. The plan has four strands. Containing the virus, delaying its spread, researching its origins and cure, and finally mitigating the impact should the virus become more widespread. That is, contain, delay, research, mitigate. And let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus, this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we’ve already seen. But I fully understand public concern, your concern, about the global spread of this virus. And it is highly likely that we will see a growing number of UK cases. And that’s why keeping the country safe is the government’s overriding priority. And our plan means we’re committed to doing everything possible based on the advice of our world leading scientific experts to prepare for all eventualities. Let’s not forget – we already have a fantastic NHS, fantastic testing systems and fantastic surveillance of the spread of disease. We will make sure the NHS gets all the support it needs to continue their brilliant response to the virus so far. The plan does not set out what the government will do, it sets out the steps we could take at the right time along the basis of the scientific advice. Our country remains extremely well prepared, as it has been since the outbreak began in Wuhan several months ago. Finally, crucially, we must not forget what we can all do to fight this virus, which is to wash our hands, you knew I was going to say this, but wash our hands with soap and water. And forgive me for repeating this but there will be people who will be tuning into this for the first time: wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. It’s simple advice but it’s the single most important thing we can do, as I think our experts would attest. But at this stage, and with the exception of all of the points I have just mentioned, I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, there are all sorts of reasons why the city in which we now sit is the most productive region in the whole of Europe the time zone, the language, the agglomeration of talents and above all we have the mass transit system that every day conveys millions of people efficiently and affordably with tubes and trains and 8600 buses into the central activities zone in the morning and out in the evening like the respiration of some vast undersea coelenterate and as that public transport network has expanded in the last 150 years it has brought hope and opportunity and job prospects to people growing up in every part of the city and beyond and it is the ambition of this government to employ that same utensil - fantastic transport infrastructure - to unite and level up across the whole country and of course there is far more to do in London - and the present mayor frankly needs to be shaken out of his complacency - but there is even more to do across the nation as a whole Whether you are stuck in a jam on the A303 or on the outskirts of Lincoln whether you are trying to get from Warrington to Manchester or toiling across the Pennines by rail you know that this country is being held back by our inadequate infrastructure and so in the next few weeks this government will be setting out more details of a transport revolution because we all know the potential of transport to change your life and the life of your town or city and we know that efficient transport can clean the air and cut pollution and get cars off the road We can simultaneously reach our ambition of net zero by 2050 and we can shorten your commute and give you more time with your family and increase productivity and bring business and investment to left behind communities and that is why we are embarking now on a massive programme of investment in local transport Starting with a record-breaking £5 billion of new investment in buses and bicycles. An investment that will mean bus passengers across the country seeing a dramatic improvement in their daily journeys. More than 4,000 brand-new buses on the roads – zero carbon British built buses –on the roads of places Ashfield, Barnstaple, Southampton, Manchester and many more towns and cities besides. More services, including in the evenings and weekends. Simpler, cheaper and more convenient ticketing. Properly designed priority schemes to speed passengers past the traffic jams. And it’s an investment that will also mean cyclists enjoying hundreds of miles of brand-new separated lanes. With “Mini-Hollands” blooming like so many tulips in towns and cities right across the country. And that £5 billion, Mr Speaker. is just the start My very good friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be making a full announcement on this in next month’s Budget and I have no desire to steal his thunder. but I can signal today that we are taking forward transformative investments improvements from Cornwall, to the A1 north of Newcastle from south Salisbury to south Ribble from Cheadle to Chiverton dual carriageways, roundabouts, bypasses, underpasses And those are just the roads. We have already set out plans to explore new investments in the rail network across the North. Developing proposals to reopen the Fleetwood Line in Lancashire and Ashington-Blyth rail line in the North East. Improving track and platform capacity at Middlesbrough station. And installing new signalling at Harrogate, one of North Yorkshire’s busiest stations. And further south, I can today announce that we will be upgrading the Bristol East junction – a major pinch point in the rail network of the South West that limits access to the Brunel-designed Victorian splendour of Bristol Temple Meads Station. Mr Speaker the transport revolution is local because it must be local we can unite and level up across the country with fantastic local improvements with better rail and less congested roads and beautiful built buses that are cleaner, greener, quieter and above all more frequent and above all we can improve the quality of life and improve their productivity we can make places more attractive to live in and to invest in but we cannot make these improvements in isolation from one another because we will only be doing half the job we will not fix the great musculoskeletal problem of UK transport yes we must fix the joint between the knee bone and the thigh bone and the shin bone and the ankle bone and yes we must fix the arthritis in the fingers and the toes but we also have to fix the spine, Mr Speaker and our generation faces a historic choice We can try to get by with the existing routes from north to south we can consign the next generation to overcrowding, standing up in the carriageways or we can have the guts to take a decision – no matter how difficult –unlike the party opposite by the way Mr Speaker – no matter how difficult and controversial – that will deliver prosperity to every part of the country 50 minutes off the time to Glasgow When it comes to advocating HS2 it must be said that the task is not made easier by HS2 Ltd – the company concerned Speaking as an MP whose constituency is on the route I cannot say that HS2 Ltd has distinguished itself in the handling of local communities As everybody knows, the cost forecasts have exploded But poor management to date has not detracted in my view from the fundamental value of the project. The review recently conducted by Douglas Oakervee copies of which will be placed in the library of the House leaves no doubt of the clinching case for high speed rail A vast increase in capacity, with hundreds of thousands of extra seats. making it so much easier for travellers to move up and down our long, narrow country. That means faster journey times Not just more capacity – it means faster journey times extraordinarily fast journey times Passengers arriving at Birmingham Airport will be able to get to central London by train in 38 minutes which compares favourably with the time it takes to get from Heathrow by taxi – a point I just draw attention to the house but this is not just about getting from London to Birmingham and back this is about finally making – and considerably faster than the Piccadilly line – finally making a rapid connection from the west Midlands to the northern powerhouse to Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and simultaneously permitting us to go forward with Northern powerhouse rail across the Pennines finally giving the home of the railways the fast connections they need and none of it makes any sense without HS2 The Infrastructure and Projects Authority considers that this first phase can be delivered for its current projected cost of £35 billion to £45 billion in today’s prices. The designs have been improved immeasurably thanks to the tireless contributions of campaigners including the Rt Hon Member for Chesham and Amersham. And if we start now, services could be running by the end of the decade. So today Mr Speaker, the Cabinet has given high speed rail the green signal. We are going to get this done. And to ensure that we do so without further blowouts on either cost or schedule, we are today taking decisive action to restore discipline to the programme. I will be appointing a Minister whose full-time job will be to oversee the project. A new Ministerial oversight group will be tasked with taking strategic decisions about it. There will be changes to the way HS2 is managed. We will, in line with Oakervee’s recommendations, be interrogating the current costs to identify where savings can be made in phase 1 without the costs and delays that would be associated with a detailed redesign. And, so that the company can focus solely on getting phases 1 and 2A built on something approaching on time and on budget I will be creating new delivery arrangements for both the grossly behind-schedule Euston terminus, and phase 2B of the wider project. But before those designs are finalised and legislation introduced, we will also present an integrated plan for rail in the north. Informed by an assessment from the National Infrastructure Commission it will, in line with the findings of the Oakervee review, look at how we can best design and integrate rail investments across the north – including Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester, - and I have just spoken to the Mayor of Greater Manchester who has warmly welcomed this project - which I committed to supporting I remember during my first days in office. I want the plan to identify the most effective design and sequencing of all relevant investments in the north. For example, with many in the north crying out for better east/west links instead of improved north/south ones, which you’ve heard many times in this house …some have suggested delaying or even cancelling HS2 in order to get Northern Powerhouse Rail done more quickly. But I want to say to you Mr Speaker and to the House, this is not an either/or proposition. Both are needed, and both will be built – as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. To make sure that happens we will, working closely with northern leaders, explore options for creating a new delivery vehicle for Northern Powerhouse Rail. And we will start treating HS2, north of Birmingham, Northern Powerhouse Rail and other local rail improvements as part of one integrated masterplan, High Speed North. Because something has to change. Those who deny this, who say we should simply build 2B and Northern Powerhouse Rail according to the plans currently on the table, are effectively condemning the North to get nothing for 20 years. And that would be intolerable. So as we draw up this plan we are not asking whether phase 2B is not to be. That is not the question, Mr Speaker The question is how we can bring a transport revolution to the north sooner. Together, this revolution in local and national transport has the potential to be truly transformative for the entire country. Yes, it is ambitious. But ambition frankly is what we have lacked for too long. Two centuries ago our ancestors could have been content with breeding faster horses. Instead, they invented the railways. They created the transport network on which the United Kingdom rose to economic pre-eminence. They looked to the future of transport and they made it happen and today it is our duty to do the same. Let us bring about a future where high-speed trains glide between our great cities. Where electric buses convey us cleanly around our towns. Where self-driving cars roam along roads that are free of the congestion that causes so much pollution. And where a new generations of cyclists pedal safely and happily to school and work in tree dappled sunlight on their own network of fully segregated cycle paths. This government – as we did in London - will deliver a new anatomy of British transport A revolution in this nation’s public transport provision. And a sign to the world that in the 21st century this United Kingdom still has the vision to dream big dreams and the courage to bring those dreams about. I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Last week Mala told me her story, including the scene that awaited Ian and our British forces when they liberated Bergen Belsen almost 75 years ago. I am lost in admiration for Mala’s courage and endurance and her unwavering determination to ensure that we remember. As she said to me, the Holocaust is unique, because it was the industrialised murder of a race, of 6 million Jews, of whom 1.5 million were children, along with millions of other targets of Nazi persecution. As Prime Minister, I promise that we will preserve this truth forever. I will make sure we build the National Holocaust Memorial and Education Centre, so that future generations can never doubt what happened, because that is the only way we can be certain that it never happens again. And I feel a deep sense of shame that here in Britain – in 2020 – we seem to be dealing with a resurgence of the virus of anti-semitism - and I know that I carry responsibility as Prime Minister to do everything possible to stamp it out. As we resolutely proclaim “never again”, it is right that we should also ask what happened to our resolve in the genocides that followed in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. And as I stand here, in the presence of many of Britain’s Holocaust survivors, I feel a special obligation towards the sanctity of their testimonies, because nothing can compare with hearing directly from a survivor. I will do everything I can as Prime Minister to ensure these testimonies are shared as widely as possible, encouraging the use of technology so the tangible, palpable, irrefutable reality of this experience is preserved as something not just for this generation but for every generation. In doing so, we will ensure that Britain never forgets the truth of the Holocaust. In the name of all those who perished, may their memory be a blessing for ever. 

Boris:


Good morning. Heads of state, heads of government.  Business leaders. Friends. Good morning to you all and a very warm welcome to London, to the UK, and to a new start in our business partnership between my country and your countries and indeed the whole continent of Africa. I am reliably informed that this is the very first time that the UK and quite so many African nations have come together for an event of this kind. And when we celebrate all sorts of exciting new beginnings, the start of a new year, a new decade, a new government here in Britain, it is an event whose time has come. And indeed an event that is long overdue. An event that I regard as the climax of considerable personal exertion because during my two years as foreign secretary I visited more African nations than any other senior British politician in living memory Ghana, the Gambia, Libya, Liberia, Uganda, Nigeria, Cote D’Ivoire, Somalia, Kenya, Egypt, Ethiopia -  where in a fit of brilliance our excellent ambassador decided that I should challenge Haile Gebrselaissie to a running race in Addis Abba at an altitude of 2355 m, and in fierce sunshine, over a distance of about a mile. And I had to pretend to have a heart attack in order to get him to slow down and what everybody said was that it was a very convincing impersonation of a man having a heart attack. And wherever I was I am proud to say I found a lot of interest and lot of affection for the UK and even a lot of love. But I also realised that we in the UK have a vital job in continuing to convince people across the continent that we’re not just a great friend and ally, a reliable ally, but also the people you should be doing business with. We have no divine right to that business. This is a competitive world. You have many suitors. Some of you may be off shortly to sample the delights of Davos. But look today at what we have to offer, look around the world today and you will swiftly see that the UK is not only the obvious partner of choice.  We also are very much the partner of today, of tomorrow and decades to come. Because the truth is, in 2020 the UK is the ultimate one-stop shop for the ambitious, growing international economy. If you want investment in a new project or enterprise just hop on the tube and one stop from here you’ll be in the heart of Canary Wharf, where, along with its older sibling in the City of London, trillions of pounds of capital are being raised for every venture you can think of from French construction to African telecoms to American cancer curing drugs. In every currency you have heard of and some that have only been recently invented and it may give you some idea of the scale of the financial services in London when I say that Canary Wharf alone is a bigger banking centre than the whole of Frankfurt. We have the tech. We have ed tech, med tech, fin tech, bio tech, green tech, nano tech. Tech of all kinds. And we have by far the biggest tech sector anywhere in this hemisphere, two or three times bigger than our rivals, and that works in synergy of course with our amazing higher education sector. We have more of the world’s top universities than any other country outside the US. Every year, thanks to our Chevening and Commonwealth Scholarships, their doors are opened to the best and brightest students from every part of Africa. And I am proud to say today that one in seven of the world’s Kings, Queens, Presidents, Prime Ministers were educated in this country including the Japanese emperor. We have a total global monopoly on the higher education of emperors. Thank you – it’s true. And if you want to come here to study in those universities, if you want to play a part in the hi-tech revolution, if you want to work with the titans of our financial world, then you’ll be pleased to hear, my friends, that one thing is changing. Our immigration system.  I know it’s an issue that people have raised with me in the past but change is coming. And our system is becoming fairer and more equal as between all our global friends and partners. Treating people the same regardless, wherever they come from and by putting people before passports, we will be able to attract the best talent from around the world, wherever they may be. Because I appreciate, as I say, that there is no shortage of governments out there touting for your business. China, I must mention the competition, I better I mean why not, China, Russia, Germany. I’m told there will be a conference in France fairly soon. But in the words of an old Akan proverb that I picked up while I was in Ghana, “All fingers are not the same.” There is wisdom in these Akan proverbs. All fingers are not the same and all countries are not the same, and the UK boasts a breadth and depth of expertise that simply cannot be matched by any other nation. And that’s why we are already one of the biggest partners for countries across Africa. Look at the billions of pounds worth of deals that are being finalised just here today and that we are announcing. The monorail trains. The monorail trains that will shortly be conveying citizens through the streets of Cairo, that great and growing city, will be made here. The monorail trains will be made here in the UK in Derby. In Nigeria’s Oyo state every street light is being installed with low carbon high efficiency low emission diodes from Dorset. I had no idea they made these things in Dorset. There you go. Families across Angola will shortly be tucking into delicious wholesome chicken from Northern Ireland. Thousands of tonnes, millions of birds, for millions of years the birds of this country have flown south to Africa for the winter. But it is thanks to the miracle of free trade that today our birds go plucked, frozen, oven ready. And at the same time of course, and I think Uhuru Kenyatta asked me this question, the BA planes coming the other way are sometimes quite chilly. A point that the President of Kenya raised with me and I made representations on his behalf. And one of the reasons may be is that the holds of those planes are full each of them with 13 tonnes of sliced and refrigerated fruit coming to the supermarkets of the UK. And of course we want to build a new future as a global free trading nation, that’s what we are doing now and that’s what we will be embarking on, on the 31st January this month. But I want to intensify and expand that trade in ways that go far beyond what we sell you or you sell us. We want to go far beyond though I have just told President Museveni of Uganda that his beef cattle will have an honoured place on the tables of post Brexit Britain. Yes, he’s very proud of them and quite rightly. But I want to go beyond that. Because what I am really talking about is building a partnership that benefits all of us. And it’s about synergies and partnerships and it means things like Diageo spending $167 million to make its east African breweries as clean, efficient and sustainable as possible through biomass, solar power, water recovery and purification. And it means encouraging people like Lolade Oresanwo. Born in Nigeria, Lolade came to the UK to study at one of our many world-leading higher education institutions.  So armed with an MBA she headed back to Lagos and, in 2014, helped set up what is now the region’s biggest waste-processing operation, West Africa ENRG. Every day, every day, yes let’s hear it for Lolade, everyday her team scoop up 2,000 tonnes of rubbish destined for landfill. They sift out the stuff that can be recycled and then – very soon – they’re going to start using the rest to generate clean electricity for schools and hospitals. And the whole thing is run using mostly British-made equipment, because, even if I say it myself, it’s the best in the world, and it’s backed by UK investors, with ongoing research and development support from Lolade’s alma mater, Cranfield University. So Lolade and her team make the local streets cleaner and the global environment greener. They have created 3,000 jobs in Nigeria, the vast majority of them for women. They help keep the order books full for British manufacturers. And the whole operation provides a tidy return for investors both in Nigeria and in the UK. It is a great example of what the modern UK/Africa partnership looks like. An exchange of ideas, equipment and finance to solve common problems. A relationship that benefits us all and makes a lasting, difference. And the same is true of the UK government’s $53 million investment at the Port in Mombasa. A serious, commercially minded development like many other overseas investments in Africa. But rather than being arranged on extraordinarily one-sided terms and delivered by a vast imported workforce, without wishing to cast aspersions on any other potential partner, it was a sustainable deal that created jobs for ordinary Kenyans now and in the future. And it was made all the easier for British businesses to work with and trade with their Kenyan counterparts and vice-versa. I’m told that probably partly as a result of what is going on in Mombasa half of all the tea drunk in the UK comes to us from Kenya. Think of that. Britain without a nice cup of tea is barely worth thinking about, and that means Britain without Kenya is barely worth thinking about. Literally sustained, kept sane and rational throughout the day by infusions of Kenyan supply tea. Even if it doesn’t originate in Kenya it comes through Kenya, you’ve got to be careful about that. And it is the sustainable, forward-thinking nature of that investment in Mombasa that marks us out, I would say, as different from the global crowd. And that kind of sustainable thinking applies to our shared environment every bit as much as it does to our common business interests. Climate change and loss of biodiversity are issues that affect us all. I know that many of your countries are already on the front line in the fight against both and I look forward to seeing many of you again when the UK hosts COP26 in Glasgow later this year. And of course one of the many reasons we were chosen to host COP26 was the incredible speed with which we have cleaned up our domestic energy industry. A decade ago we were the most carbon heavy nation in Europe - one of the most carbon-heavy nations in Europe. Today, we are a world-leader in offshore wind. We regularly generate more of our electricity from renewables than from fossil fuels, regularly. And we have almost entirely weaned ourselves off coal.  But there’s no point in the UK reducing the amount of coal we burn if we then trundle over to Africa and line our pockets by encouraging African states to use more of it. Is there? We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky, and we all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms. So from today, the British government will no longer provide any new direct official development assistance, investment, export credit or trade promotion for thermal coal mining or coal power plants overseas. To put it simply, not another penny of UK taxpayers’ money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity. Instead, we’re going to focus on supporting the transition to lower- and zero-carbon alternatives. First, by helping you to extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible. We are world-leaders in that and have much to share. But also by turbocharging, if turbo-charging is a word I can use in the context of low-carbon energy technology, our support for solar, and wind and hydro and all the other carbon-free sources of energy that surround us, and are just waiting to be harnessed. If I can’t say turbo charging, what can I say, we’re going to deliver an electro convulsive lightning bolt through our renewables industry. That process is already underway, because a whole host of British companies are already working with national governments across Africa and around the world to increase renewable capacity. There’s a huge myth about this, people say that you have to choose between reducing emissions and raising economic growth. Look at what happened here in the UK. Actually we have cut CO2 by 42 per cent since 1990 and yet GDP has gone up 67 per cent. And we stand ready to help you do the same. Tackling the causes of climate change, while also delivering the power needed to unlock the potential of all our people. And what an incredible potential that is. Africa is a continent of amazing, independent and diverse nations.  But they – you - have some things in common clearly. Some of you are members of the Commonwealth - 19 members of the Commonwealth – look forward to the summit in Kigali. But one thing that unites African countries is ambition, and optimism and, by comparison with much of the rest of the world, quite staggering levels of growth. More than half the world’s fastest, 15 fastest growing economies are in Africa. Two-thirds of African economies are expanding faster than the global average.  Africa is the future and the UK has a huge and active role to play in that future. And I hope you agree. Because we are, and we will be, a partner, your partner through thick and thin. Our universities are helping to educate the next generation of African entrepreneurs. By helping to provide securities, I’ve seen myself, in Somalia, South Sudan, the Sahel and beyond. Our businesses, our investors, our entrepreneurs, our mind-bogglingly innovative financial services sector are helping Africans from Casablanca to Cape Town to face the future with confidence. Today, here in London, here in this fantastic hotel, which I think I gave planning permission for. In the days when I was - a lot of the stuff you see around I helped to build I am proud to say. This fantastic city. We are bringing together leaders of nations and businesses, and I hope that this meeting will serve as a great cyclotron of talent in which ideas and people will come together and spark some flash of creativity. And, at the start of this new decade, we, the UK and your nations, are taking the first steps on the road to a new partnership between all our people. And like, whatever the apparent differences in our skill sets and our abilities and the complementarity, like me and Haile Gebreselaissie thundering round Addis Ababa, we want to be with you, side by side, every step of the way. So let’s seize the opportunities that are before us here today. Let’s build the partnerships for the future. And, together, let us begin to write the next chapter for my country, for your country, and above all for all the peoples of our countries. Thank you all for very much for coming and welcome to London. 

Boris:


We, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, share fundamental common security interests, along with our European partners. One of them is upholding the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and ensuring that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) plays a key role in this respect. Together, we have made clear our regret and concern at the decision by the United States to withdraw from the JCPoA and to re-impose sanctions on Iran. Despite increasingly difficult circumstances, we have worked hard to preserve the agreement. All remaining parties to the JCPoA, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and Iran, with the EU as coordinator, have stated their continuing commitment to preserve the JCPoA. It is essential that Iran return to full compliance with its commitments under the agreement. We have expressed our deep concern at the actions taken by Iran in violation of its commitments since July 2019. These actions must be reversed. We reserve recourse to all the provisions of the JCPoA to preserve it and to resolve the issues related to Iran’s implementation of its JCPoA commitments within its framework. We will also need to define a long-term framework for Iran’s nuclear programme. Recent events have highlighted Iran’s destabilising role in the region, including through the IRGC and Al-Qods force. Our commitment to the security of our allies and partners in the region is unwavering.  We must address - through diplomacy and in a meaningful way - shared concerns about Iran’s destabilizing regional activities, including those linked to its missile programme. We reiterate our readiness to continue our engagement for de-escalation and stability in the region. We note Iran’s announcement with regard to the shooting down of UIA Flight PS752 and commit to working with Iran on next steps. Today, our message is clear: we remain committed to the JCPoA and to preserving it; we urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the agreement and return to full compliance; we call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation; and we remain ready to engage with Iran on this agenda in order to preserve the stability of the region. 

Boris:


This is a momentous day. As we begin a new decade, we can now look forward to a brighter future for all in Northern Ireland with an Executive that can transform public services and improve people’s lives. The parties of Northern Ireland have shown great leadership in coming together to accept this fair and balanced deal in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland. After three years without devolved Government, an Executive can now get on with the job of delivering much needed reforms to the health service, education and justice. We could not have got this far without the Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith who has dedicated himself to this process and has worked closely with the Northern Ireland parties and Irish Government to make this happen. 

Boris:


Iran’s admission that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by mistake by its own armed forces is an important first step. This will be an incredibly difficult time for all those families who lost loved ones in such tragic circumstances. We will do everything we can to support the families of the four British victims and ensure they get the answers and closure they deserve. We now need a comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation and the repatriation of those who died. The UK will work closely with Canada, Ukraine and our other international partners affected by this accident to ensure this happens. This tragic accident only reinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region. We can all see very clearly that further conflict will only lead to more loss and tragedy. It is vital that all leaders now pursue a diplomatic way forward. 

Boris:


I am deeply saddened to hear of the death of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, Sultan of Oman. He was an exceptionally wise and respected leader who will be missed enormously. He will be remembered for his devotion to the development of Oman into a stable and prosperous nation, and as the father of the nation who sought to improve the lives of the Omani people. I had the pleasure of meeting His Majesty Sultan Qaboos and was struck by his commitment to peace and understanding between nations and between faiths. He leaves a profound legacy, not only in Oman but across the region too. The UK is a proud friend and enduring partner of Oman, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Omani people. 

Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson said – 
The loss of life on Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 is a tragedy and my thoughts are with all of those who lost loved ones. Four British nationals were among those who were killed, and we are providing support to their families at this most terrible time. There is now a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian Surface to Air Missile. This may well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation. It is vital that there should be an immediate and respectful repatriation of those who’ve lost their lives to allow their families to grieve properly. The UK continues to call on all sides urgently to deescalate to reduce tensions in the region. 


Boris:


Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 
Today I have spoken with President Macron, President Trump and Chancellor Merkel and will be speaking with other leaders in the coming days. General Qasem Soleimani posed a threat to all our interests and was responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region. Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death. 

It is clear however that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no one’s interest. 

We are in close contact with all sides to encourage de-escalation. I will be speaking to other leaders and our Iraqi friends to support peace and stability. The Foreign Secretary has been in constant contact with leaders and foreign ministers from across the globe and we have taken steps to increase the security of our personnel and interests in the region. Following further international engagement and ministerial meetings here in the UK, Parliament will be updated on Tuesday. 


Boris:



Watch the Prime Minister’s Christmas message here 
Hi folks, Boris Johnson here, taking a moment to wish you all a merry little Christmas. It’s that special time of year when, whatever has gone before, we can take an opportunity to celebrate all that is good in the world and to spend time with our friends and family. Christmas Day is, first and foremost, a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a day of inestimable importance to billions of Christians the world over. I hope you are all enjoying a wonderful break with your loved ones, sharing gifts and tucking into some delicious food. Of course, as many of us are enjoying a break at this time of year, let’s not forget all those who have selflessly put their celebrations on hold. On behalf of the whole country I want to say a huge thank you to our amazing NHS staff, many of whom will be working throughout the holidays to take care of us. Thank you also to our police, and all those public servants working tirelessly this Christmas. I also want to express my personal gratitude to the wonderful members of our Armed Forces currently on deployment – and therefore to their friends, family and children back home who will have an empty chair at the table when they tuck in to their Christmas dinner. Today of all days, I want us to remember those Christians around the world who are facing persecution. For them, Christmas Day will be marked in private, in secret, perhaps even in a prison cell. As Prime Minister, that’s something I want to change. We stand with Christians everywhere, in solidarity, and will defend your right to practice your faith. 
So as a country let us reflect on the year, and celebrate the good that is to come. Folks, I hope you enjoy the next few days. Try not to have too many arguments with the in-laws, or anyone else. And whoever you are, wherever you are, and however you’re celebrating, have a very happy Christmas, and  I’ll see you all again in the New Year. 

Boris:


My mission is very simple, it is to say thank you. Because of course in the next few days everybody in our country is going to spend Christmas with their families, and you are going to be here. A long way away, in a pretty cold place, at Christmas, in the Baltic States in Estonia. And what you are doing is incredibly important because the reason everybody in our country can have Christmas in peace and security is because of what you are doing here. Quite literally what you are doing is showing that NATO works, and that NATO is an alliance to which we in this country are absolutely committed. And the idea of NATO is very, very simple. It’s all for one and one for all. And that means that when our Estonian friends want a commitment by the British Army we make that commitment with this Enhanced Forward Presence. And they love it. It does fantastic things for the local community and I talked earlier on to Prime Minister Jüri Ratas and he says that the contribution of British  troops is fantastic and all the engagement with the local population is wonderful. But it’s about much more than that. It’s a demonstration by our country that we are committed to the security and stability of the whole of Europe, and you are the most vivid and powerful possible symbol and expression of that support and commitment. And that is why one billion people are protected by the NATO alliance. The most successful military alliance in history. And that is why we have peace and security and stability in Europe, and peace and stability in Europe for seventy years. And it is an incredible thing for me to come to Estonia and think that when I was a kid, when I was your age actually, Estonia was part of the Soviet Union and we are now here helping to protect Estonia and to guarantee its security. It is a fantastic thing, it is a deeply moving thing for someone of my generation. Thank you all very much for what you are doing. Happy Christmas. 

Boris:


This morning I went to Buckingham Palace and I am forming a new government and on Monday MPs will arrive at Westminster to form a new parliament and I am proud to say that members of our new one nation government – a people’s government – will set out from constituencies that have never returned a Conservative MP for 100 years and yes they will have an overwhelming mandate, from this election, to get Brexit done and we will honour that mandate by Jan 31 and so in this moment of national resolution I want to speak directly to those who made it possible and to all those who voted for us, for the first time, all those whose pencils may have wavered over the ballot and who heard the voices of their parents and their grandparents whispering anxiously in their ears I say thank you for the trust you have placed in us and in me and we will work round the clock to repay your trust and to deliver on your priorities with a parliament that works for you and then I want to speak also to those who did not vote for us or for me and who wanted and perhaps still want to remain in the EU and I want you to know that we in this one nation conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings – of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe because now is the moment – precisely as we leave the EU – to let those natural feelings find renewed expression in building a new partnership, which is one of the great projects for next year and as we work together with the EU as friends and sovereign equals in tackling climate change and terrorism in building academic and scientific cooperation, redoubling our trading relationship I frankly urge everyone on either side of what after three and a half years after all an increasingly arid argument I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin because I believe, in fact I know, because I have heard it loud and clear from every corner of the country that the overwhelming priority of the British people now is that we should focus above all on the NHS that simple and beautiful idea that represents the best of our country with the biggest ever cash boost 50,000 more nurses, 40 new hospitals as well as providing better schools, safer streets and in the next few weeks and months we will be bringing forward proposals to transform this country with better infrastructure, better education, better technology and if you ask yourselves what is this new government going to do, what is he going to do with his extraordinary majority I will tell you that is what we are going to do we are going to unite and level up – unite and level up bringing together the whole of this incredible United Kingdom England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland together taking us forward unleashing the potential of the whole country delivering opportunity across the entire nation and since I know that after five weeks frankly of electioneering this country deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics, and a permanent break from talking about Brexit I want everyone to go about their Christmas preparations happy and secure in the knowledge that here in this people’s government the work is now being stepped up to make 2020 a year of prosperity and growth and hope and to deliver a Parliament that works for the people thank you all very much and happy Christmas.

It was agreed amongst all of us that 70 years after its foundation here in London, it is absolutely true to say that NATO is the most successful alliance in history and it now guarantees the peace and prosperity of a billion people around the world in 29 countries. It will shortly be 30 of course, now that North Macedonia is joining. And everybody also attested to the fundamental reason for the success of that alliance and it is based on the idea of solidarity, in defence of our values of freedom and democracy, the basic idea of all for one and one for all encapsulated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty that we come to each other’s mutual defence. That’s why NATO works and that’s why it’s so powerful and so successful. And of course the UK has long argued that you can’t be complacent about that, you can’t remotely take that for granted, you’ve got to ensure that we continue to spend on our collective defence and that’s why we’ve made the case for 2% of GDP as the minimum NATO spend for every member. And we’ve been successful in that campaign, because if you look at what’s happened since the Cardiff summit in 2014, actually there has been a substantial increase in spending by our European friends of $130 billion dollars - it will rise to $400 billion by 2024. And at this meeting here today and country after country pledged or gave an account of how they were going to meet the pledge of 2%. I was able to sketch out some of the ways which the UK leads in for instance the European contribution to the NATO readiness initiative and we are contributing one armed brigade, two squadrons of fast jets, six major warships - including the two aircraft carriers. And several other delegations, several other nations, also emphasised that were going to step up their contributions to the readiness initiative amongst other things. And there was a mood of very great solidarity and determination and a willingness to push NATO forward, not just for the next few years but for the next 70 years. A real belief in the long-standing value of this alliance. And we also had good discussions on Russia, how we should respond collectively to Russia, the need to be aware of Russia but also the need to engage. We discussed cyber, the challenges of what is going on in cyberspace, the asymmetric warfare and threats that we collectively face, the need for us to engage together in looking at the challenges from space and working together to develop a policy on space. We also agreed that we would, having heard a really terrible account of the earthquake in Tirana in Albania from Edi Rama, we also agreed that we would act collectively to help the people of Tirana and Durres to get back on their feet. And that was the essence of the discussion that I think was extremely practical and extremely harmonious. 

Boris:


I’m delighted to welcome everybody here to the UK to celebrate the 70th anniversary of NATO. I feel as if our alliance is coming home because Britain was a founding member and it was here that NATO opened its first headquarters – of course in Belgrave Square in London shortly before moving to Paris, as colleagues will recall. Seventy years on, we are rock solid in our commitment to NATO and to the giant shield of solidarity that now protects 29 countries and nearly a billion people. The fact that we live in peace today demonstrates the power of the simple proposition at the heart of this alliance: that for as long as we stand together, no-one could hope to defeat us - and therefore no-one will start a war. This essential principle is enshrined in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty: that if any one of us is attacked, all of us will go to their defence. If NATO has a motto, it is as Jens says, one for all, and all for one. This doctrine of coming to one another’s aid, incarnated by NATO, provides the single most important explanation for why the British people and hundreds of millions of our friends live in peace and freedom today. Everything our peoples hold dear – from liberty and democracy to their jobs, homes, schools and hospitals – would not be secure and could not flourish without the peace that NATO is designed to guarantee. But history shows that peace cannot be taken for granted and even as we celebrate this anniversary, we must ensure that our deeds match our words and the atrocity in London last Friday shows why we must work together to combat terrorism and the vital importance of NATO’s missions to counter this threat. For the UK’s part, we spend over 2% of GDP on defence. We are proudly making the biggest contribution of any European ally to NATO’s Readiness Initiative by offering an armoured brigade, two fighter squadrons and six warships, including the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers. As friends and allies, we must never shy away from discussing new realities, particularly NATO’s response to emerging threats like hybrid warfare and disruptive technologies including space and cyber. At this Council, we have the opportunity to strengthen the unity of purpose that has made NATO the greatest and most successful alliance in history and to take the new steps that are profoundly necessary to ensure another 70 years of peace and security. 

Boris:


Before I begin, let me say I will be making quite a lengthy speech this afternoon, reflecting the very comprehensive nature of the report. So if Hon and Rt Hon members bear with me I am sure that I will address whatever issues they may be planning to intervene on. Mr Speaker, the bereaved, the survivors, and the members of the north Kensington community joining us in the galleries today each have their own story to tell, their own perspective on what happened at Grenfell. But, over the past two-and-a-half years, they have been united in their fight to uncover the truth. It is not a fight they would ever have chosen. But it is one that they have taken up with determination, with dedication, and with great dignity. Yet their exceptional tenacity in seeking justice has not always been matched by their faith in the system’s ability to deliver. This is no surprise. After all, they have been let down many times before. Too often overlooked and ignored in the months and years before the tragedy. And, shamefully, failed by the institutions that were supposed to serve them in the days and weeks after it. Since then the survivors, the bereaved and the local community have endured one unbearable milestone after another. The funerals. The anniversaries. Giving and hearing evidence at the public inquiry. The painful process of building a new life in a new home without loved ones and without treasured possessions. And then the publication of this report today. And all this while carrying with them the unimaginable trauma suffered that night. I am very much aware that no report, no words, no apology will ever make good the loss suffered and the trauma experienced. But I hope that the findings being published today, and the debate we are holding this afternoon, will bring some measure of comfort to those who suffered so much. They asked for the truth. We promised them the truth. We owe them the truth. And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017. When the sun rose over London that morning, it revealed an ugly scar of black smoke cutting across an otherwise clear blue summer sky – and, on the streets of north Kensington, a scene of horror and desperation. Shortly before one o’clock that morning a faulty fridge-freezer had started a small fire in the kitchen of a flat on the fourth floor of the 24-storey Grenfell Tower. The resident of that flat did everything right. He raised the alarm, called the fire brigade, alerted his neighbours. Within five minutes firefighters arrived to deal with what appeared to be a routine incident. And in the normal course of events, the fire would have been contained, extinguished, and that would have been that. But what happened that night was anything but normal. And so, even before firefighters began to tackle the blaze on the inside of the tower, unbeknown to them flames were already beginning to race up the outside. Just seven minutes after the first firefighters entered the kitchen on the fourth floor, a resident on the 22nd dialled 999 to report the blaze at her level, almost 200 feet higher up. By 1:27am a column of fire had reached the roof.
One whole side of the building was ablaze. Dense smoke and searing flames, visible across the capital, began wrapping around the tower, penetrating its heart. And by 1:30am, less than three-quarters-of-an-hour after it began, it was clear to those watching below that the inferno was completely out of control. Grenfell Tower – filled that night with almost 300 souls in its 129 flats – was beyond saving. The fire that shocked the nation and the world that June morning took the lives of 72 men, women and children. The oldest, known simply as Sheila, was a poet, artist and great-grandmother, who had brought joy to many and seen and experienced much in her 84 years. The youngest, Logan Gomes, had never even seen his own parents – he was stillborn hours after his mother made a narrow escape from the choking, noxious smoke. Many who lived together died together: husbands and wives, parents and children, were found in each other’s arms. Those who survived saw everything they owned reduced to dust and ash – wedding dresses, irreplaceable photographs, beloved children’s toys, all gone. And the true scale of the trauma – the impact of the fire not only on those who survived but those who lost loved ones or witnessed its destruction – is unlikely ever to be known. Grenfell represented the biggest loss of life in a single incident in the UK since the Hillsborough tragedy 28 years previously. However my predecessor as Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Member for Maidenhead, was determined that there would be no repeat of the travesty that followed that disaster – which saw the friends and families of those who died forced to fight the establishment tooth and nail, year after year, decade after decade to secure justice for their loved ones. That is why, just 15 days after the tragedy, the then Prime Minister appointed one of our most experienced and respected former judges, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, to lead a rigorous, public and completely independent inquiry into what happened. Sir Martin has today published his report on the first Phase of that inquiry, covering the events of 14 June. The cause of the fire and its rapid spread, and the way in which emergency services and others handled the immediate response. As the sponsoring Minister under the terms of the Inquiries Act 2005, I have this morning laid copies of the report before Parliament. I was in no doubt that the House should have the opportunity to debate it on the day of publication. Grenfell was a national tragedy – and this is a report of great national importance. However I recognise that Sir Martin has produced a very substantial piece of work, almost a thousand pages across four volumes. And the vast majority of Hon and Rt Hon members will not yet therefore have had the opportunity to digest and analyse it in any great detail. I believe that Members do have an important role to play in scrutinising such reports and the government’s response to them. So let me reassure the House that we will seek to schedule a further debate on Sir Martin’s findings at the earliest suitable opportunity so that members can debate the report in detail. This may obviously be after the election – but we will ensure it will happen. But of course what happened in the hours that the fire raged is only half the story. Phase two of the inquiry, which will start taking oral evidence early in the new year, will look at the wider context. And this will include the nature and application of building regulations, the way in which local and central government responded to the fire, and the handling of concerns raised by tenants over many years. Phase one sets out WHAT happened; phase two will explain WHY. And such a complex process will inevitably take time. Longer than any of us would wish. But, as I said, we owe it to the people of Grenfell Tower to explain, once and for all and beyond all doubt, exactly why the tragedy unfolded as it did. And, with the standard set by this first report, I am confident that is exactly what will happen. Sir Martin’s work is exhaustive in its detail. He provides an authoritative and often harrowing minute-by-minute account of the fire and its terrifying spread. Led always by the facts, his recommendations are clear and numerous. And where there are failings to be highlighted, Sir Martin does so without fear or favour. Nowhere is that clearer than in Sir Martin’s verdict on the single biggest cause of this tragedy. He leaves no doubt that the cladding on the exterior of Grenfell Tower was the defining factor in the rapid and all-consuming spread of the blaze. It was the cladding – the aluminium composite material rain screen and the combustible insulation behind it – that ignited because of the fire in flat 16. It was the cladding that allowed the flames to climb so rapidly up the outside of the tower, causing compartmentation to fail. And it was the cladding that turned into molten plastic, raining fire on the streets of north Kensington and causing the blaze to travel down and down the building as well as up. In short it was the cladding that turned a routine and containable kitchen fire into a disaster of unprecedented proportions that cost 72 people their lives. Sir Martin is clear that the cladding on Grenfell Tower was fitted in breach of building regulations. And why this was allowed to happen – and who was responsible for it – will be covered in phase two of his inquiry. But we cannot afford to stand by and wait for his full conclusions. As the report says, it is essential that all similar cladding is removed as quickly as possible. That is why the previous Government established a fund to pay for the removal of such systems from tall residential buildings. I’m pleased to say that all such buildings owned by central and local government have now had their cladding removed, and are undergoing work to remove it or at the very least have such work scheduled. In the private sector progress is slower. Too many building owners have not acted responsibly. While the people living in those privately owned buildings are safe – round-the-clock fire patrols and other temporary measures ensure that is the case – I’m in no doubt they need a long-term and lasting solution. Nearly all private high rise residential buildings where such cladding remains are now in line to have remedial work scheduled. Where that is not case, the government will work with local authorities to take enforcement action if landlords refuse to deal with the problems themselves. I think the House would agree they’ve had enough time. There are no more excuses. Make those buildings safe or face the consequences. The cladding on Grenfell Tower caused the fire to spread out of control and to behave in ways nobody had seen before. And this unprecedented fire created an unprecedented challenge for the many men and women sent to fight it. Mr Speaker, since 2017 much has been written, from many perspectives, about the way in which the London Fire Brigade handled the unfolding disaster. So let me be very clear from the start. After examining all the evidence and listening to hundreds of witnesses and experts, Sir Martin does not call into doubt the actions or bravery of any of the rank-and-file firefighters dispatched to Grenfell Tower. No one or any of us in this House or the Other Place. As mayor of this great city I saw for myself the courage and commitment demonstrated by the men and women of the London Fire Brigade. And as Sir Martin report bears that out, telling of firefighters exhibiting and I quote “extraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty” as they pushed themselves “to and even beyond the limits of endurance”, facing choking smoke and temperatures as high as a thousand degrees Celsius. Their work that night was nothing short of phenomenal. However, Sir Martin concludes that the firefighters on duty that night were “faced with a situation for which they had not been properly prepared”. He finds that the London Fire Brigade’s planning and training for such an incident were “gravely inadequate” and that on the night of the fire there were “serious deficiencies” I quote in command and control. The report highlights a lack of co-ordination between emergency services – what Sir Martin calls a “serious failure” of stated policies. And I think this will be the point that will be of most concern to those who lost loved ones – he finds that the failure to order an evacuation of the tower once the fire was clearly out of control most probably led to the deaths of individuals who could otherwise have been saved. The so-called “stay put” policy is the bedrock on which all plans for fighting fires in tall residential buildings are based. Building regulations are supposed to mean that fires cannot spread beyond individual flats, that they are compartmented. When that is the case, it is indeed safest for most residents to stay in their homes until the fire is extinguished. But at Grenfell, that was the not case. The fire spread – both widely and rapidly – up, and down and across the tower. The inquiry found that, by 1:30am, it was clear that compartmentation had failed. By 1:50am it was still not too late to order an evacuation. Yet, according to Sir Martin, senior officers simply could not conceive of a situation where compartmentation could fail so comprehensively. In the report, “stay put” is described as such an article of faith within the fire service that senior officers were reluctant to let the reality before them override their training. And as a result, the decision to order an evacuation was not taken until 2:35am – by which time the tower’s single staircase was already filling with impenetrable smoke. Even after this time, poor and confused lines of communication meant that operators in the 999 control room were not aware that the advice had changed. Swamped by the sheer volume of calls and dealing with a challenge well outside their experience and training, some continued to give conflicting advice to callers trapped inside the tower. Sir Martin notes that many operators did not realise how all-encompassing the fire had become until well after 5am, when a lull in calls allowed them to check their phones and see images of the burning building for the first time. Information gleaned from callers inside the tower was faithfully recorded, but only rarely made its way to firefighters who could act upon it. While brave firefighters led many people to safety from inside the tower, Sir Martin concludes the chaos and confusion meant that some calls for help were not responded to until it was too late. Sir Martin cautions against making judgements at a distance, and I agree with him wholeheartedly It is very easy for us, on these green benches, to have 20:20 hindsight. And we are not about to run into the heart of a fire that is blazing more than 200 feet into the night sky. And while I believe it is vital that individuals are held accountable for their errors, we must do so carefully. It is clear from this report that the firefighters on the ground were in a position they should never have been in… Doing their damnedest to tackle a fire that should never have been allowed to happen. But that does not absolve us of responsibility. We must ensure that the failures identified by the inquiry are corrected. For not only does Sir Martin highlight that mistakes made by the London Fire Brigade in responding to the Lakanal House fire were repeated, he also raises concerns that the London Fire Brigade is “at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire”. It is vital that they do so. And I’m sure everyone at the London Fire Brigade will want to do so. Because, as an MP, as mayor or as a journalist, I have never met a firefighter who was anything less than totally committed to public safety. And I will be working with the London Fire Brigade, the mayor’s office, and local authorities across London to ensure the lessons of Grenfell are learned and Londoners are made safer for it. I can confirm that, where Sir Martin recommends responsibility for fire safety be taken on by central government, we will legislate accordingly. And, more widely, we plan to accept, in principle, all of the recommendations that Sir Martin makes of central government. We will set out how we plan to do so as quickly as possible. But I can assure the House – and all those affected by the Grenfell tragedy – that where action is called for, action will follow. Mr Speaker, for the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community this report will prove particularly harrowing. Yet I hope it will strengthen their faith in Sir Martin’s desire to determine the facts of the fire – and this government’s commitment to airing those facts in public, no matter how difficult they may be, and acting on them. That commitment is absolute. Because if any good is to come of this senseless tragedy – a tragedy that should never have happened… If it is to become a catalyst for a change in our approach to fire safety and indeed to social housing more widely, then we must get to the truth about what happened and why. We must expose and fix the failings that allowed an otherwise safe building to become so dangerous… That allowed a small kitchen fire to become a devastating inferno… That led to so many people being told to stay in their homes when they could and should have been fleeing to safety. The inquiry is a vital part of that. I would like to thank Sir Martin and his team for all their work so far, and I know that all current and former ministers, civil servants and all public sector workers will fully co-operate with phase two. But while I know that in uncovering the truth is very important to the survivors and bereaved, it is not the only aspect of the post-Grenfell story that requires our attention. So we will continue – as the previous Prime Minister promised – to support the affected families, long after the television cameras are gone. We will continue the work of the Grenfell Ministerial Recovery Group, which brings together the efforts of all parts of Government, central and local, in meeting the needs of the community. We will continue work to ensure that a beautiful and appropriate memorial is created on the site of the tower – a process that is being led by the bereaved and the local community. We will continue to make sure that those affected by the fire have an active and engaging role to play in implementing the lessons of Grenfell – including working closely with the Ministry of Housing to develop the policies in our social housing white paper. We will continue to implement the findings of the Hackitt review of building regulations. And I have asked the civil servants responsible for implementing Sir Martin’s recommendations to provide me with regular and frequent updates on their progress. I will not allow the lessons of this tragedy to fall through the cracks. Mr Speaker, the night of 14 June was a horrendous night. But in the darkness we have also seen the best of humanity. The residents who sacrificed their own lives to save their children or neighbours. The local community that rallied around in such an incredible fashion, holding the survivors in a tight embrace as the authorities failed to step up. And the people here with us today. The bereaved and the survivors. Those who would have every reason to hide away, but who have instead fought to uncover the truth about what happened that terrible night. Who have forced themselves to relive, time and again, the kind of trauma that most of us, mercifully, cannot begin to imagine. And who have dedicated so much of their lives in so many ways to ensuring that those who died on the 14th June 2017 will always be remembered. To them I say once again that the truth will out. That justice will be done. And that Grenfell Tower and the people who called it home will never be forgotten. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I am very grateful to you, I am very grateful to the House of Commons staff, everybody who’s put themselves out, everybody who has come to give up their time in this debate today. It’s been a very important debate, an exceptional moment for our country, an exceptional moment for our Parliament. Alas the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has been effectively been passed up because the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning. But I wish the House to know that I’m not daunted or dismayed by this particular result and I think it probably became likely once it was obvious that the amendment from my Right Honourable Friend the Member for West Dorset was going to remain on the order paper. I continue in the very strong belief that the best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31. And to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so. I will tell our friends and colleagues in the EU exactly what I’ve told everyone in the last 88 days that I’ve served as Prime Minister: that further delay would be bad for this country, bad for the European Union and bad for democracy. So next week the Government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31. And I hope that our European Union colleagues and friends will not be attracted as the benches opposite are by delay. I don’t think they’ll be attracted by delay. And I hope that then Honourable Members faced with a choice of our new deal, our new deal for the UK and the European Union, will change their minds because it was pretty close today. I hope that they will change their minds and support this deal in overwhelming numbers. Since I became Prime Minister I‘ve said we must get on and get Brexit done on October 31 so that this country can move on. Mr Speaker, that policy remains unchanged, no delays, and I will continue to do all I can to get Brexit done on October 31 and I continue to commend this excellent deal, Mr Speaker, to the House. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I want to begin by echoing what you’ve just said, my gratitude to all members of the House for assembling on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years and indeed to all members of the House of Commons staff who have worked to make this possible. I know this has meant people giving up their Saturdays, breaking into their weekends at a time when families want to be together, and of course it means missing at least the end of England’s World Cup quarter final. I apologies to the House for that and I wish I could watch it myself. I know the Honourable Member for Cardiff West has postponed his 60th birthday party – if not his 60th birthday – to be here. So Mr Speaker the House has gone to a great deal of trouble to assemble here on a Saturday for the first time in a generation. And I do hope for the purposes of a meaningful vote that we will indeed be allowed to have a meaningful vote this evening. And with permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the new agreement with our European friends. The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three and half years after the nation voted for Brexit. And during those years, friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution. But I hope Mr Speaker, that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us. Many times in the last 30 years I have heard our European friends remark that this country is half-hearted in its EU membership and it is true that we in the UK have often been a backmarker opting out of the single currency, not taking part in Schengen, very often trying to block some collective ambition. And in the last three years and a half years it has been striking that members on all sides of this House have debated Brexit in almost entirely practical terms in an argument that has focused on the balance of economic risk and advantage. And I don’t think I can recall a time when I have heard a single member stand up and call for Britain to play her full part in the political construction of a federal Europe. I don’t think I’ve heard a single member call for an ever closer union or ever deeper integration or a federal destiny – mon pays Europe - perhaps I’ve missed it but I don’t think I’ve heard much of it Mr Speaker. And there is a whole side of that debate that you hear regularly in other European capitals that is simply absent from our national conversation and I don’t think that has changed much in the last 30 years. But if we have been sceptical, and if we have been anxious about the remoteness of the bureaucracy, if we have been dubious about the rhetoric of union and integration, if we have been half-hearted Europeans, Then it follows logically that with part of our hearts, with half our hearts, we feel something else, a sense of love and respect for European culture and civilisation of which we are a part; a desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything, creatively, artistically, intellectually. A sense of our shared destiny and a deep understanding of the eternal need – especially after the horrors of the last century - for Britain to stand as one of the guarantors of peace and democracy in our continent. And it is our continent. And it is precisely because we are capable of feeling both things at once - sceptical about the modes of EU integration as we are but passionate and enthusiastic about Europe - that the whole experience of the last few years has been so difficult for this country and so divisive. And that is why it is now so urgent for us to move on and build a new relationship with our friends in the EU on the basis of a new deal - a deal that can heal the rift in British politics, unite the warring instincts in us all. And now is the time for this great House of Commons to come together and bring the country together today as I believe people at home are hoping and expecting, with a new way forward and a new and better deal both for Britain and our friends in the EU, and that is the advantage of the agreement that we have struck with our friends in the last two days. Because this new deal allows the UK - whole and entire - to leave the EU on October 31st in accordance with the referendum while simultaneously looking forward to a new partnership based on the closest ties of friendship and co-operation. And I pay tribute to our European friends for escaping the prison of existing positions and showing the vision to be flexible by re-opening the Withdrawal Agreement and thereby addressing the deeply felt concerns of many in this House. And one of my most important jobs is to express those concerns to our European friends. I shall continue to listen to all Honourable Members throughout the debate today, to meet with anyone on any side and to welcome the scrutiny the House will bring to bear if - as I hope – we proceed to consider the Withdrawal Agreement Bill next week. Today this House has an historic opportunity to show the same breadth of vision as our European neighbours. The same ability and resolve to reach beyond past disagreements by getting Brexit done and moving this country forwards, as we all yearn to do. This agreement provides for a real Brexit, taking back control of our borders, laws, money, farming, fisheries and trade, amounting to the greatest single restoration of national sovereignty in Parliamentary history. It removes the backstop which would have held us against our will in the Customs Union and much of the Single Market. For the first time in almost five decades the UK will be able to strike free trade deals with our friends across the world to benefit the whole country – including Northern Ireland. Article 4 of the Protocol states: “Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom”. It adds “nothing in this Protocol shall prevent” Northern Ireland from realising the preferential market access in any free trade deals “on the same terms as goods produced in other parts of the United Kingdom.” Our negotiations have focused on the uniquely sensitive nature of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. And we have respected those sensitivities. Above all, we and our European friends have preserved the letter and the spirit of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and upheld the long-standing areas of co-operation between the UK and Ireland, including the Common Travel Area. And as I told the House on 3rd October, in order to prevent a regulatory border on the island of Ireland we proposed a regulatory zone covering all goods, including agrifood, eliminating any need for associated checks along the border. And Mr Speaker, in this agreement we have gone further by also finding a solution to the vexed question of customs, which many in this House have raised. Our agreement ensures – and I quote – “unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom’s internal market.” It ensures that there should be no tariffs on goods circulating within the UK customs territory, that is between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, unless they are at risk of entering the EU. It ensures an open border on the island of Ireland, a common objective of everyone in this House. And it ensures that for those living and working alongside the border there will be no visible or practical changes to their lives – they can carry on as before. I believe this is a good arrangement, reconciling the special circumstances in Northern Ireland with the minimum possible bureaucratic consequences at a few points of arrival into Northern Ireland. And it is precisely to ensure that those arrangements are acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland that we have made consent a fundamental element of this new deal. So no arrangements can be imposed on Northern Ireland if they do not work for Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland will have the right under this agreement to express or withhold their consent to these provisions, by means of a majority vote in their Assembly four years after the end of the transition. And if the Assembly chooses to withhold consent, these provisions “shall cease to apply” after two years, during which the Joint Committee of the UK and EU would propose a new way forward, in concert with Northern Ireland’s institutions. And as soon as this House allows the process of extracting ourselves from the EU to be completed, the exciting enterprise of building our new relationship with our friends can begin which has been too long delayed. And Mr Speaker, I do not wish this to be the project of any one Government or any one party but rather the endeavour of the United Kingdom as a whole. Only this Parliament can make this new relationship the work of the nation. And so Parliament should be at the heart of decision-making as we develop our approach. And I acknowledge that in the past we have not always acted in that spirit. So as we take forward our friendship with our closest neighbours and construct that new relationship I will ensure that a broad and open process draws upon the wealth of expertise in every part of this House including select committees and their chairs. Every party and every Member who wishes to contribute will be invited to do so. And we shall start by debating the mandate for our negotiators in the next phase. Mr Speaker, the ambition for our future friendship is contained in the revised Political Declaration which also provides for this House to be free to decide our own laws and regulations. I have complete faith in this House to choose regulations that are in our best tradition of the highest standards of environmental protections and workers’ rights. No one anywhere in this chamber believes in lowering standards, instead we believe in improving them as indeed we will be able to do and seizing the opportunities of our new freedoms. For example, free from the Common Agricultural Policy, we will have a far simpler system where we will reward farmers for improving our environment and animal welfare many of whose provisions are impossible under the current arrangements, instead of just paying them for their acreage. And free from the Common Fisheries Policy, we can ensure sustainable yields based on the latest science not outdated methods of setting quotas. And these restored powers will be available not simply to this Government but to every future British Government of any party to use as they see fit. That is what restoring sovereignty means, that is what is meant in practice by taking back control of our destiny. And our first decision, on which I believe there will be unanimity is that in any future trade negotiations with any country our National Health Service will not be on the table. Mr Speaker, I am convinced that an overwhelming majority in this House, regardless of our personal views, wishes to see Brexit delivered in accordance with the referendum. A majority. And in this crucial mission there can no longer be any argument for further delay. As someone who passionately believed that we had to go back to our European friends to seek a better agreement, I must tell the House that with this new deal the scope for fruitful negotiation has run its course. They said that we couldn’t re-open the Withdrawal Agreement, Mr Speaker, they said we couldn’t change a comma of the Withdrawal Agreement, they said we couldn’t abolish the backstop, Mr Speaker, we’ve done both. But it is now my judgement that we have reached the best possible solution. So those who agree, like me that Brexit must be delivered and who - like me – prefer to avoid a no deal outcome, must abandon the delusion that this House can delay again. And I must tell the House in all candour that there is very little appetite among our friends in the EU for this business to be protracted by one extra day. They have had three and a half years of this debate. It has distracted them from their own projects and their own ambitions and if there is one feeling that unites the British public with a growing number of the officials of the EU it is a burning desire to get Brexit done. and I must tell the House again in all candour that whatever letters they may seek to force the government to write, it cannot change my judgment that further delay is pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust. And people simply will not understand how politicians can say with one breath that they want delay to avoid no deal and then with the next breath that they still want delay when a great deal is there to be done. Now is the time Mr Speaker to get this thing done, and I say to all members let us come together as democrats to end this debilitating feud. Let us come together as democrats behind this deal, the one proposition that fulfils the verdict of the majority but which also allows us to bring together the two halves of our hearts, to bring together the two halves of our nation. Let’s speak now both for the 52 and the 48. Let us go for a deal that can heal this country, let’s go for a deal that can heal this country and allow us all to express our legitimate desires for the deepest possible friendship and partnership with our neighbours A deal that allows us to create a new shared destiny with them. And a deal that also allows us to express our confidence in our own democratic institutions, to make our own laws, to determine our own future, to believe in ourselves once again as an open, generous global, outward-looking and free-trading United Kingdom. That is the prospect that this deal offers our country. It is a great prospect and a great deal, and I commend it to the House. 

Boris:


I particularly thank Michel Barnier and his team. I thank Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the Commission, for all the personal effort that he has put in to getting this deal done. And I want to stress that this is a great deal for our country, for the UK. I also believe it is a very good deal for our friends in the EU. And what it means is that we in the UK can come out of the EU as one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, together, and it means we can decide our future together, we can take back control, as the phrase goes, of our money, our borders, our laws, together. And we will be able to do free trade agreements around the world. We can also build now, after three and a half years, we can build now on our relations with our friends and partners in the EU. And it’ll be a very exciting period now, as it were, to get to the positive side of that project - the extraction having been done, the building now begins. And I’m very confident that when my colleagues in Parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday, and then in succeeding days. This is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done, and come out on October the 31st. This is our chance to focus on our priorities, the people’s priorities, the NHS, putting 20,000 police on the streets, lifting up funding of education across the country, the biggest expansion of the living wage. Those are the things I think the people of our country want us to be focusing on in addition to Brexit. We have been at this now, as I say, for three and a half years. It hasn’t always been an easy experience for the UK. It has been long, it has been painful, it has been divisive, and now is the moment for us as a country to come together. Now this is the moment for our parliamentarians to come together and get this thing done, and, as I say, to begin building a new and progressive partnership with our EU friends, with whom, of course, we share so many priorities. 

Boris:


With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the government’s proposals for a new agreement with our European friends that would honour the result of the referendum and deliver Brexit on 31st October - in an orderly way with a deal. This government’s objective has always been to leave with a deal. And these constructive and reasonable proposals show our seriousness of purpose. They do not deliver everything that we would have wished. They do represent a compromise. But to remain a prisoner of existing positions is to become a cause of deadlock rather than breakthrough. And so we have made a genuine attempt to bridge the chasm, to reconcile the apparently irreconcilable. And to go the extra mile as time runs short. Our starting point is that this House promised to respect the referendum before the vote. More people voted Leave than voted for any political party in our history. This referendum must be respected. Both main parties promised at the 2017 election that they would respect the referendum and there would be no second referendum. This House voted to trigger Article 50 and has voted repeatedly to leave. Yet it also voted three times against the previous Withdrawal Agreement and for repeated delay. And so, as I have emphasised time and again, there can be no path to a deal except by reopening the Withdrawal Agreement and replacing the so-called backstop. While, as I stand here today, we are some way from a resolution, it is to the credit of our European friends that they have accepted the need to address these issues. And I welcome the constructive calls I have had over the last twenty-four hours including with President Juncker, Chancellor Merkel, Taoiseach Varadkar and the statement from President Juncker that the Commission will now examine the legal text objectively. The essence of our new proposal is a new Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland consisting of five elements. In the first place all our actions are based on our shared determination to sustain the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, the fundamental basis of governance in Northern Ireland the protection of which is the highest priority of all. And from this follows the second principle – namely that we shall of course uphold all the longstanding areas of co-operation between the UK and our friends in Ireland including the rights of all those living in Northern Ireland, North/South co-operation and the Common Travel Area, which predates both the Good Friday Agreement and the European Union itself. Third, we propose the potential creation of a regulatory zone on the island of Ireland covering all goods, including agri-food. For as long as it exists, this zone would eliminate all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland. But fourth, unlike the so-called backstop, such a regulatory zone would be sustained with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, as expressed through the Assembly and Executive. They will give their consent during the transition period as a condition for these arrangements entering into force. Thereafter, the Assembly will vote again every four years - and if consent were withheld, these arrangements would then lapse after one year. Fifth, it has always been a point of principle for this government that at the end of the transition period, the UK should leave the EU Customs Union whole and entire restoring sovereign control over our trade policy and opening the way for free trade deals with all our friends around the world. That is a fundamental point for us, Mr Speaker. So, under the proposals in this new Protocol, Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory not the EU Customs Union. But there will be no need for checks – or any infrastructure – at or near the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Indeed, I have already given a guarantee that the UK government will never conduct checks at the border and we believe that the EU should do the same, so there is absolute clarity on that point. Instead under this new Protocol all customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland would take place either electronically or in the small number of cases where physical checks would be necessary, they would happen at traders’ premises or other points in the supply chain. We have put forward a method for achieving this based on improving and simplifying existing rules, trusting certain traders and strengthening our co-operation with Ireland in a spirit of friendship and sensitivity to the particular circumstances. So while these proposals will mean changes from the situation that prevails today in Ireland and Northern Ireland it is their driving purpose to minimise any disruption. And in order to support the transition further we propose a New Deal for Northern Ireland that will boost economic growth and competitiveness and set in train new infrastructure, particularly with a cross-border focus. Mr Speaker, the previous Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration would have permanently anchored the United Kingdom within the orbit of EU regulation and customs arrangements. And an indefinite so-called backstop provided a bridge to that vision of the future. This Government has a different vision – basing our future relationship with our European neighbours on a Free Trade Agreement and allowing the UK to take back control of our trade policy and our regulations. And we propose to amend the Political Declaration to reflect this ambition. Our proposals should now provide the basis for rapid negotiations towards a solution in the short time that remains. I do not for one moment resile from the fact that we have shown great flexibility in the interests of reaching an accommodation with our European friends and achieving the resolution for which we all yearn. If our European neighbours choose not to show a corresponding willingness to reach a deal then we shall have to leave on 31st October without an agreement and we are ready to do so. But that outcome would be a failure of statecraft for which all parties would be held responsible. When I think of the conflicts that have wracked Europe in the past of the immense challenges that we have together surmounted of the 74 years of peace and prosperity we have together achieved I believe that surely we can summon the collective will to reach a new agreement. Mr Speaker, this government has moved our proposals do represent a compromise and I hope the House can now come together in the national interest behind this new deal. To open a new chapter of friendship with our European neighbours and move on to our domestic priorities – including education, infrastructure and our NHS. So Mr Speaker, let us seize this moment to honour our over-riding promise to the British people respect Brexit and get Brexit done and I commend this Statement to the House. 

Boris:


Mr President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, faithful late night audience. It is customary for the British Prime Minister to come to this United Nations and pledge to advance our values and defend our rules, the rules of a peaceful world. From protecting freedom of navigation in the Gulf To persevering in the vital task of achieving a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East. And of course I am proud to do all of these things. But no-one can ignore a gathering force that is reshaping the future of every member of this Assembly. There has been nothing like it in history When I think of the great scientific revolutions of the past - print, the steam engine, aviation, the atomic age - I think of new tools that we acquired but over which we - the human race - had the advantage, Which we controlled. That is not necessarily the case in the digital age. You may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor – even your personal trainer – but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google. And if that is true today, in future there may be nowhere to hide. Smart cities will pullulate with sensors, all joined together by the “internet of things”, bollards communing invisibly with lamp posts So there is always a parking space for your electric car, so that no bin goes unemptied, no street unswept, and the urban environment is as antiseptic as a Zurich pharmacy. But this technology could also be used to keep every citizen under round-the-clock surveillance. A future Alexa will pretend to take orders. But this Alexa will be watching you, Clucking her tongue and stamping her foot In the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object: your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese, your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler; your smart meter will go hustling - if its accord - for the cheapest electricity. And every one of them minutely transcribing your every habit in tiny electronic shorthand, Stored not in their chips or their innards - nowhere you can find it, But in some great cloud of data that lours ever more oppressively over the human race A giant dark thundercloud waiting to burst And we have no control over how or when the precipitation will take place And every day that we tap on our phones or work on our ipads - as I see some of you doing now - We not only leave our indelible spoor in the ether But we are ourselves becoming a resource Click by click, tap by tap. Just as the carboniferous period created the indescribable wealth - leaf by decaying leaf - of hydrocarbons. Data is the crude oil of the modern economy And we are now in an environment where We don’t know who should own these new oil fields We don’t always know who should have the rights or the title to these gushers of cash And we don’t know who decides how to use that data Can these algorithms be trusted with our lives and hopes? Should the machines - and only the machines - decide whether or not we are eligible for a mortgage or insurance Or what surgery or medicines we should receive? Are we doomed to a cold and heartless future in which computer says yes - or computer says no With the grim finality of an emperor in the arena? How do you plead with an algorithm? How do you get it to see the extenuating circumstances And how do we know that the machines have not been insidiously programmed to fool us or even to cheat us? We already use all kinds of messaging services that offer instant communication at minimal cost. The same programmes, platforms, could also be designed for real-time censorship of every conversation, with offending words automatically deleted, indeed in some countries this happens today. Digital authoritarianism is not, alas, the stuff of dystopian fantasy but of an emerging reality. The reason I am giving this speech today is that the UK is one of the world’s tech leaders - and I believe governments have been simply caught unawares by the unintended consequences of the internet; A scientific breakthrough more far-reaching in its everyday psychological impact than any other invention since Gutenberg And when you consider how long it took for books to come into widespread circulation The arrival of the internet is far bigger than print It is bigger than the atomic age - But it is like nuclear power in that it is capable of both good and harm - but of course it is not alone As new technologies seem to race towards us from the far horizon We strain our eyes as they come, to make out whether they are for good or bad - friends or foes? AI - what will it mean? Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population? or pink eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race? What will synthetic biology stand for - restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables. Will nanotechnology help us to beat disease, or will it leave tiny robots to replicate in the crevices of our cells? It is a trope as old as literature that any scientific advance is punished by the Gods When Prometheus brought fire to mankind In a tube of fennel, as you may remember, that Zeus punished him by chaining him to a tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again And this went on for ever - a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our parliamentarians had their way. In fact it was standard poetic practice to curse the protos heuretes - the person responsible for any scientific or technical breakthrough If only they had never invented the ship, then Jason would never have sailed to Colchis and all sorts of disasters would never have happened And it is a deep human instinct to be wary of any kind of technical progress In 1829 they thought the human frame would not withstand the speeds attained by Stephenson’s rocket And there are today people today who are actually still anti-science. A whole movement called the anti-Vaxxers, who refuse to acknowledge the evidence that vaccinations have eradicated smallpox And who by their prejudices are actually endangering the very children they want to protect And I totally reject this anti-scientific pessimism. I am profoundly optimistic about the ability of new technology to serve as a liberator and remake the world wondrously and benignly, indeed in countless respects technology is already doing just that. Today, nanotechnology - as I mentioned earlier - is revolutionising medicine by designing robots a fraction of the size of a red blood cell, capable of swimming through our bodies, dispensing medicine and attacking malignant cells like some Star Wars armada Neural interface technology is producing a new generation of cochlear implants, allowing the gift of hearing to people who would not otherwise be able to hear the voices of their children. A London technology company has worked out how to help the blind to navigate more freely with nothing more than an app on their smartphones - New technologies, produced in Britain, helping the deaf to hear and the blind to see. And we used to think that printing was something you did to run off a boarding card Now a British company has used 3D printing to make an engine capable of blasting a rocket into space. In African countries, millions of people without bank accounts can now transfer money using a simple app; they can buy solar energy and leap in one transaction from no electricity to green power. And new advances are making renewable energy ever cheaper, aiding our common struggle against climate change. Our understanding of the natural world is being transformed by genome sequencing. The discovery of the very essence of life itself The secret genetic code that animates the spirit of every living being. And allows medical breakthroughs the like of which we have never known. Treatments tailored to the precise genetic makeup of the individual. So far, we have discovered the secrets of less than 0.3 percent of complex life on the planet, Think what we will achieve when – and it is a matter of when – we understand 1 or 2 percent, let alone 5 or 10 percent. But how we design the emerging technologies behind these breakthroughs – and what values inform their design –will shape the future of humanity. That is my point to you tonight my friends, my Excellencies - At stake is whether we bequeath an Orwellian world, designed for censorship, repression and control, or a world of emancipation, debate and learning, where technology threatens famine and disease, but not our freedoms. Seven decades ago, this General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with no dissenting voices, uniting humanity for the first and perhaps only time behind one set of principles. And our declaration - our joint declaration - upholds “freedom of opinion and expression”, the “privacy” of “home or correspondence,” and the right to “seek…and impart information and ideas”. Unless we ensure that new technology reflects this spirit, I fear that our declaration will mean nothing and no longer hold. So the mission of the United Kingdom and all who share our values must be to ensure that emerging technologies are designed from the outset for freedom, openness and pluralism, with the right safeguards in place to protect our peoples. Month by month, vital decisions are being taken in academic committees, company boardrooms and industry standards groups. They are writing the rulebooks of the future, making ethical judgements, choosing what will or will not be rendered possible. Together, we need to ensure that new advances reflect our values by design. There is excellent work being done in the EU, the Commonwealth, and of course the UN, which has a vital role in ensuring that no country is excluded from the wondrous benefits of this technology, and the industrial revolution it is bringing about. But we must be still more ambitious. We need to find the right balance between freedom and control; between innovation and regulation; between private enterprise and government oversight. We must insist that the ethical judgements inherent in the design of new technology are transparent to all. And we must make our voices heard more loudly in the standards bodies that write the rules. Above all, we need to agree a common set of global principles to shape the norms and standards that will guide the development of emerging technology. So - here’s the good news - I invite you next year to a summit in London, a wonderful city, where by the way it is not raining 94 per cent of the time, and where at one stage - when I was Mayor of London - we discovered that we had more Michelin starred restaurants even than Paris. The French somehow rapidly recovered - by a process that I wasn’t quite sure was entirely fair. But we still have by far, in the UK, by far the biggest tech sector - fintech, biotech, meditech, nanotech, green tech - every kind of tech - in London - the biggest tech sector anywhere in Europe, perhaps half a million people working in tech alone. I hope you will come there, where we will seek to assemble the broadest possible coalition to take forward this vital task Building on all that the UK can contribute to this mission as a global leader in ethical and responsible technology. If we master this challenge – and I have no doubt that we can – then we will not only safeguard our ideals, we will surmount the limits that once constrained humanity and conquer the perils that once ended so many lives. Together, we can vanquish killer diseases, eliminate famine, protect the environment and transform our cities. Success will depend, now as ever, on freedom, openness and pluralism, the formula that not only emancipates the human spirit, but releases the boundless ingenuity and inventiveness of mankind, and which, above all, the United Kingdom will strive to preserve and advance. Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your kind attention. 

Boris:


Thank you very much for that welcome and I’m very, very proud to be standing here in front of this incredible creation which of course symbolises my message to you this morning. Because it is designed by the same man who sculpted the beautiful domes of the London Routemaster bus. I’m proud also to be the first Prime Minister of the UK to be born in New York – a very, very, very expensive decision that that turned out to be. And it’s a very exciting time in our country, we’re getting on with delivering Brexit and I just want to say a word or two about that. Because there’s been a court case in our country this morning of which I – it would be remiss or wrong of me not to address that directly and we’ve got our friends from the UK media here as well - and I just want to say to everybody watching back home for the avoidance of doubt, I have the highest respect of course for our judiciary and the independence of our courts But I must say, I strongly disagree with this judgement, and we in the UK will not be deterred from getting on and delivering on the will of the people to come out of the EU on October 31st. Because we were mandated to do. And we will simultaneously refuse to be deterred from delivering on what I think you will all expect to be an exciting dynamic, domestic agenda intended to make our country even more attractive to live in and to invest in. So we are pushing on with infrastructure, investing in police, investment in our NHS and to do that we will need a Queen’s speech to set out what we are going to do. And I think frankly, that is what the people in my country of the UK want to see. They want to see us delivering on getting on with a strong domestic agenda and believe you me, they want to see Brexit delivered by October 31st. Anyway that’s what you need to know about what’s happening in the court today. But I can tell you that under any circumstances, court judgements or otherwise my heart lifts when I come to New York. There’s something amazing, the snap, fizz, the energy in this city. I love the blue sky, against the sky scrapers, the weird strange Martian water towers on the tops of the buildings. It’s the things that in New York you never find anywhere else. But there are many ways in which New York and London are not just similar but actually united. And it isn’t just that we share a language – kind of. We have a basic idea of freedom, the idea that common to our democracies. That if you obey the law and you do no harm to others then you can come and live your life as you please. Without being judged or censured. And it is the excitement of that freedom that brings people of talent to New York as it brings people to London. And so you get this cyclotron effect the flash of inspiration that leads to innovation and to prosperity and growth. And very often it will be a synthesis between American and British ideas. We invented for instance the underground train. You invented the safety brake elevator - take them together and you’ve got the recipe for a metropolis. And you can see the same fusion today across our cities in every sphere from tech to the arts to newspapers. You know the figures, actually they’re going up I think around 1.2 million US people employed by UK companies and a million or more in the UK, Trade now worth 200 billion a year, going up the whole time. Colossal investment. But to cut to the chase, we now want to do so much more – because our country is going up. And on October 31 the UK intends to be more global, more outward-looking and more committed to the rest of the world than ever before. And we are going to take advantage of all the freedoms that Brexit can give. Whether that is new tax allowances for investment. Or speeding up public procurement contracts. Or creating new free ports and enterprise zones. Or devising better regulation for sectors in which the UK leads the world – whether that’s bioscience or financial services or whatever. More competitive tax rates and the best skilled workforce in the hemisphere. And so I say to everybody who’s done me the honour of coming this morning to this breakfast, we will roll out the red carpet for our American friends. And we are increasing the number of visas for scientists. We are ensuring that your brilliant students can stay on for two years so as to get real value from their studies. And so that our economy in the UK benefits from their expertise. We are even ensuring that US visitors are able to use the electronic e-passport system at Heathrow. And yes - we want to do the much wanted free trade deal. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy because there will be things that we do not want our NHS to be on the table, and there will be differences. And I am glad that President Trump has set up the special relationship economic working group. Because it is absolutely absurd that there should be tariffs on Californian wine. Or that British shoppers should be pay over the odds for Florida orange juice. But it is also absurd and indefensible that the population of America to the best of my knowledge has gone for decades without eating a morsel of British lamb, or beef. Let alone haggis. And I have discovered that anyone wanting to sell socks to the United States. I think they at least face a tariff of up to 19 per cent. I was told that some kinds have been taken to a laboratory and set fire to twice. There are only certain ports in the United States that are licenced to receive British cauliflower. And the US military are banned from buying British tape measures as though there was still some kind of general prejudice still against British rulers. So I ask you, my friends, is this really necessary? Let us work together to break down these barriers that have been devised by bureaucrats. Because all the evidence of the last two centuries is that free trade is the fastest and most effective way to increase the prosperity of our people. This year our country the UK takes a giant step out into the world. In keeping with our traditions but also with our new ambitions. To build on our friendships and relationships with our friends in Europe, the US and Canada. We do it with confidence to make Britain the best place in the world to start, to build and to run a business. The place you will want to be. The place you will want your business to be. And that’s why I say to everyone here – come and join us. Thank you very much. 

Boris:


It’s great to be here in Rotherham, in the magna centre which is of course the plural of magnum which as every knows is the Latin for ice cream And great to be at the biggest ever convention of the north Only right that we are meeting here on the banks of the Don, literally the crucible in which the history of the nation was forged - and indeed of the modern world When nelson defeated the French at Trafalgar and set this country on course for about 100 years of imperial expansion, the cannons on HMS Victory were forged here at Walker and Company It was Rotherham pipes that brought fresh drinking water to Hong Kong, Rotherham steel that clad Brunel’s Great Eastern and formed the skeletons of New York skyscrapers and did you know that every fire hydrant in New York was cast in British steel less than two miles from here at the works of Guest and Chrimes. That was before it occurred to anyone to put tariffs on British steel This place where we meet was so central to our national life that it was bombed in both the first and second world wars And so it was entirely fitting that 50 years ago the works here at Templeborough adopted as its logo the phoenix – perpetually rising from the ashes And across this region you can feel that phoenix-like transformation as the Northern Powerhouse – which Jake just spoke so eloquently - thrums into life with a low-carbon, fuel efficient roar Look at Catcliffe. Where a factory that once made superb glass is now being used by McLaren to turn super-light, super-strong Yorkshire carbon fibre into the fastest production cars on earth Right next door, at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Xeros Technology are producing the world’s most environmentally friendly washing machine That’s the spin and I bet it’s true Boeing chose Sheffield as its first civil aerospace factory in Europe – with nearly half its employees taken on as apprentices. And did anybody have a bagel this morning? Did you? No? Well if you did, it was probably made just up the road in Mexborough, where, in the largest bagel factory in Europe produces fully three-quarters of the bagels eaten in Britain every day. Sheffield is the home of the UK’s largest provider of hybrid and electric vehicle drive systems, a company called Magtec. A world-first initiative, Magtec is retrofitting Sheffield’s refuse lorries with battery-power, with enough juice to negotiate the seven hills and recharge themselves with energy they generate from the very rubbish they collect. Rubbish powered rubbish vans – there’s a joke there somewhere which I will leave to you. I tell you, there is no limit to the imagination, innovation, ingenuity and leadership in the North. And I have a profound belief that talent and genius are uniformly distributed around the UK. But opportunity is not, and that is why we need to level up across our amazing country, and we need investment in education, the giant precondition that determines whether you have the freedom and the confidence to make the most of your talent So this government will give every child the world class education they deserve. We are levelling up across the country Investing an extra £14 billion over three years and increasing the minimum level of funding for every pupil in primary and secondary schools. We’re backing the teachers who change our lives We are putting up salaries for new teachers, funding pension increases, and giving teachers the backing they need to deal with disruptive pupils. And we cannot afford any longer the chronic under-funding of our brilliant FE colleges, which do so much to support young people’s skills and our economy. It is absurd that employers have been driven to import so much skilled labour from abroad, in large part because of the failures of vocational training in our own country. We have a world class universities sector – we should be very, very, very proud of it -and it is time we aspired to the same status for our further education institutions, to give everyone the opportunity to express their talents. And of course education is not enough on its own, you need to be able to connect with other people To get that job interview, to find that customer And so we in this new government are supporting gigabit broadband – which is a lot I understand - for every home by 2025, eight years earlier than previously promised. And they can do it Spain. If they can do it in Spain, why can’t we do it in the UK? We have a new stronger town fund – a £3.6bn stronger town fund So that local people can invest in libraries, parks, youth clubs areas, places to bring people together And that kind of intervention cannot come, cannot be redirected, from central government So let’s be frank about we’re trying to do, what is needed most of all in addition to the technology, the infrastructure and the education we’re suppling, It’s of course local leadership. Trusting people, to take back control and run things the way that they want to. Because of course central government cannot abdicate responsibility, but only local champions can really make a difference for their towns and their communities. I am the first Prime Minister since Clement Attlee to have been a mayor – and I know the transformative potential of local, accountable leadership. Someone with the power to sort out what matters most to local people What we want to see in this region is towns and communities able to represent that gentlemen and sort out his needs, and whether it’s transport they use to get to work, or good housing – whatever it happens to be Someone to drive big infrastructure projects, to boost investment, to wave the flag for the area and act as a local champion and say: “Come and invest here.” But of course along with that power, comes responsibility and accountability. And it’s time we gave more people a say over the places where they live. We are going to do devolution properly. We are going to maximise the power of the north with more mayors across the whole of the north. And I know there is real enthusiasm for devolution in Yorkshire and I welcome the establishment of a Yorkshire Committee as a practical step for facilitating greater collaboration on a Yorkshire-wide basis. In the meantime, we are committed to getting the Sheffield City Region done – and I also want to open up negotiations with Leeds and West Yorkshire so we can make a mayor work there too, whatever the nature of any longer term arrangements in Yorkshire. But I also want to build on the fantastic job so many mayors are already doing – and ensure you can deliver on ambitious commitments to your communities. That will mean levelling up powers for existing mayors And to make sure our great Northern Powerhouse is firing on all its cylinders, to champion investment and opportunity, we are going to work with leaders across the north, the mayors, local businesses and others to create a new, stronger Northern Powerhouse growth body. It will be a genuine partnership across the region, led by a northerner chosen in close consultation with you. I imagine there will be a process to work out who’s going to do but it will be done in close consultation with you. But if there is one field of policy that can change people’s lives for the better And level up opportunity – on field of policy that in my view must now be devolved – that policy is transport Nearly two hundred years ago, this country invented a machine that went on to unite great surfaces, great areas of Great Britain, spread its iron web across the earth and it transformed everywhere it touched. The North of England gave the world the railway. And at a time when the rest of the human race could travel no faster than a galloping horse, 40,000 people watched as Locomotion One puffed its way like some fire breathing beast along the tracks between Stockton and Darlington in 1825. It was ours, a world first, the common ancestor of both the McLaren and the rubbish eating dustcart I just described And yet two centuries later, in this birthplace of the railways, we can do so much better Today – coming from London on the train, it took me just over an hour and a half to get to Doncaster. But if, for example, you travelled from Liverpool to Rotherham – less than half the distance– you might have had to leave an hour earlier than me, and change as many as three times. Your journey may have been on two and three-carriage trains, some of them built in the early 1980s with a body designed for a bus. And maybe bus seats too. I love buses – but not when they are supposed to be trains When I was in Yorkshire last week, I reaffirmed my commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail And I eagerly await your plans. And before we get on with a project of that scale I deeply believe in the absolute importance of everyday ordinary transport that people rely on. There are some terrific local transport services in the North – from Manchester’s trams and Mersey rail, the most punctual railway in Britain, to the Tyne and Wear Metro. And there has been some very significant Government investment with 2,000 additional services now operating each week, £500m on new trains, £100m on the refurbishment of the rest – including WiFi and power sockets. And as well as the electrification of the railways in the North West, And the Pacers will be gone within months. But still the overall picture is patchy. All too often, Northern England has to put up with old diesel trains, running once or twice an hour, from stations where the only form of welcome on the platform is yes, a bus shelter. William Wordsworth campaigned furiously against the railway coming to the Lake District. Last year, during the timetable meltdown, Northern and Network Rail gave him his wish. And what’s the difference between the superb services like Merseyrail, the Tyne and Wear Metro, the Manchester Metrolink and the ones let you down far too often. Well partly the answer is money But the other difference is accountability – right answer from the mayors in the front. Each of those well run services is run by, or on behalf of, locally elected politicians. And they’re always going to care more about their trains and trams than someone in Whitehall. London was just the same. Before 2000, when London Transport was run by central government, the tube was frankly shabby and neglected. But when my predecessor and I ran it as London Mayor, services improved Though I can’t speak for the current incumbent So today I am announcing my intention to give the railways of the north back to the people of the north. Back to the places where they were born. Back to Stockton and to Darlington. Back to Liverpool and Manchester. In the combined authority or joint transport committee areas in the North East, West Yorkshire, Sheffield City Region, Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, it is time for the north to run its own trains. Keith Williams, who is leading a review of the railways for us, has I think been in touch with most of the people concerned. On your local lines in metropolitan areas, we will give greater control over fares, service patterns, rolling stock and stations. And outside the combined authority areas, I want communities to take control too That might be through county councils taking on similar roles, in their areas, for stations or branch lines. Or it might be by transferring local branch line and rural services to community rail partnerships, owned by local people. And as you have asked, we will give you far greater control over your budgets. But as well as taking power, this is the kicker, you will have to take responsibility. That means alongside taking the credit, you will be taking the heat. Just like a mayor has to in London. Nobody blames the government for problems on the Central Line. They blame the Mayor of London. Now we will be generous on capital spending, but we won’t be able to afford everything that everyone wants. So choices will have to be made. And if you people want more than we can afford, then they will have to raise the money themselves. And, of course, the north’s railways must still be part of the national network which passengers tell us they want, with many trains obviously running across the boundaries of the region. So there still has to be a role for the centre. This will be a partnership between the railway and the leaders of the north. And I think it’s a formula that can work and will deliver better services for the people of this country. And that is how we do it. That is how we level up and unleash the talent of the whole country Better education, Gigabit broadband sprouting in every home Reliable comfortable and affordable transport with someone accountable delivering your service These are the pumping pistons that will drive the northern powerhouse And that Northern Powerhouse is turning before our eyes into a new locomotive for the UK economy Two centuries ago this region literally became the engine that propelled the world to new discoveries and new horizons – bringing people together, bringing countries together and bringing new opportunities for everyone. That is what the Northern Powerhouse can achieve in the 21st century and this is a Government that will back you to deliver it. 

Boris:


Thank you Leo and it is wonderful to be here. And I thank you very much for the warm welcome you’ve given us. You and I first met a few years ago when you and I jointly officiated at the St Patrick’s Day parade in Trafalgar square in London. It was a pretty joyous occasion. And of course we celebrated the incalculable contribution of the Irish community to London. And there in the vast crowds was of course the living human embodiment of one of the densest and most intricate and most vital relationships in the world between any two countries. And together Leo today we both recognise that our peoples are the beneficiaries of the efforts of our predecessors – politicians and others – who put aside differences, who found compromises, who took our countries forwards together in circumstances far tougher than now. And the results for both UK and Ireland are immense. Not just a peaceful and open border but an economic partnership by which we eat I think 50 per cent of all the cheese and beef produced in Ireland, and we are talking a lot.  And the very captain of the world cup winning English cricket team was born in this city. And I think that our job now is to take that relationship forward and to build on it at the UK-Ireland summit in November, I look forward to that, and in all the ways in which the UK and Ireland work together around the world with shared values and shared interests. As you rightly say Taoiseach, before November there are two political tasks that we simply have to do. We must restore the government of Northern Ireland at Stormont, and I promise to work with you on our shared objective. And we must get Brexit done because the UK must come out on October 31, or else I fear that permanent damage will be done to confidence in our democracy in the UK. And I know that this problem of Brexit was not, to be perfectly frank, a conundrum that Ireland ever wished for and I think there are three basic questions we need now to answer for the sake of our collective peace of mind. Can we ensure that we continue to have unchecked movement at the border of goods and people and indeed cattle? I think the answer is yes – and as someone who went to the border several times before the Good Friday agreement, and shuddered to see watchtowers on UK soil, I can say now that the UK will never ever institute checks at the border, and I hope our friends in the EU would say the same. Can we uphold the Belfast Good Friday agreement in all its particulars? Again I say the answer is yes, and our commitment to the peace process is unshakeable. Can we protect the economic unity of the island of Ireland and the gains that Ireland has won through its membership of the EU single market? And again I think the answer is yes – and I think we can achieve all these things while allowing the UK to withdraw whole and entire from the EU. And of course I acknowledge the complexities involved. And the symbolism and the sensitivities evoked by the very concept of a border. But strip away the politics and at the core of each problem you find practical issues that can be resolved. With sufficient energy and a spirit of compromise, and indeed even the current treaty must logically envisage that the problems can be solved, or the present protocol would never have been called a backstop. So if I have one message that I want to land with you today Leo, it is that I want to find a deal. I want to get a deal. Like you, I’ve looked carefully at no deal. I have assessed its consequences, both for our country and yours. And, yes, of course, we could do it, the UK could certainly get through it. But be in no doubt that it would be a failure of statecraft for which we would all be responsible and so, for the sake of business, and farmers, and for millions of ordinary people who are now counting on us to use our imagination and creativity to get this done, I would overwhelmingly prefer to find an agreement. Our governments have spent three years masticating this problem. I think it is time to honour the achievements of our predecessors who tackled far worse problems by cracking this one ourselves. I won’t say that we can do it all today, but I believe there is a deal to be done by Oct 18. Let’s do it together. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, before I begin, I am sure that the whole House will join me in remembering that it is 80 years today that this country entered the Second World War. And though it is of course true that the horror of that conflict surpasses all modern controversies, it is also true that this country still stands then as now for democracy, for the rule of law, for the fight against racial and religious hatred, and Mr Speaker I know that this House is united in defending those values around the world. Mr Speaker, with permission I will make a statement about the G7 summit in Biarritz. As I speak, vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest are on fire, free trade is in retreat, 130 million girls worldwide are not in education, our oceans are being foully polluted, And so it has never been more important for a Global Britain to use our voice as an agent of change and progress. It is only by exerting our influence at a global level, only by sticking up for our values and beliefs, that we can create the international context for Britain to prosper, and to ensure that this is greatest place on earth to live, to work, to start a family, open a business, trade and invest. And so, at the G7, I made the case for free trade as an engine of prosperity and progress that has lifted billions out of poverty. And yet the reality is that trade as a share of the world economy has been stagnant for the last decade. In the Leaders’ Declaration, the G7 unanimously endorsed “open and fair world trade”; and we’re determined to reform the World Trade Organisation and reach agreement next year to “simplify regulatory barriers”. Britain is on the verge Mr Speaker, of taking back control of our trade policy and restoring our independent seat in the WTO for the first time in 46 years. And we could achieve even more in our trade with the United States by using the powers we will regain to do a comprehensive free trade deal, a deal in which President Trump and I have both agreed that the NHS is not on the table. [Political content removed] Mr Speaker, I know that the whole House will share my concern about the gravity of the situation in Hong Kong. As a nation with a deep belief in freedom of expression and assembly, we stand firm in upholding Hong Kong’s way of life, guaranteed by one country, two systems. And I welcome the unwavering support of my G7 counterparts on this vital matter. Mr Speaker the UK is at the forefront of a new campaign to end the tragic loss of species around the world. We cannot bequeath a planet where the Sumatran Tiger and the African Elephant and entire ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef live in the shadow of destruction. So I am delighted that the G7 accepted UK proposals for more ambitious targets to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity. Britain is responsible for 2.6 million square miles of ocean – the fifth largest maritime estate in the world. Our Blue Belt programme will ensure that marine protected areas encompass 1.5 million square miles and, at the G7, I announced a further £7 million for this vital effort. I also announced another £10 million to protect the rainforest in Brazil, where 41,000 fires have raged so far this year, more than twice as many as in the same period in 2018. Britain is bidding to host the UN’s 26th Climate Change Conference next year. If we succeed, we shall focus on solutions that harness the power of nature, including reforestation. [Political content removed] There is one measure that would address all those issues and that is ensuring that every girl in the world receives the education that is her right. This would not only curb infant mortality, eradicate illiteracy and reduce population pressures, it would strike a blow for morality and justice. In Biarritz, the G7 therefore endorsed the UK’s campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world. And I announced new funding of £90 million so that 600,000 children in countries torn by conflict – where girls are twice as likely as boys to be out of the classroom – get the chance to go to school. And as well as my G7 colleagues, I was delighted to meet other leaders, including President Ramaphosa of South Africa, Prime Minister Modi of India, And Prime Minister Morrison of Australia who heroically masked his emotions in the face of the historic innings of Ben Stokes. In every conversation, I was struck by the enthusiasm of my colleagues to strengthen their relations with this country, whether on trade, security and defence, science and technology. Mr Speaker, I was also able to use the G7 to follow up my conversations in Berlin and Paris with Chancellor Merkel and President Macron on Brexit, as well with Prime Minister Conte, Prime Minister Sanchez, and President Tusk. I have since spoken to Commission President Juncker, and many other leaders. And I was able to make clear to them all that everyone in this government wants a deal. But it is a reality that the House of Commons has rejected the current Withdrawal Agreement three times and it simply cannot be resurrected. That is why I wrote to President Tusk on the 19th August to set out our arguments why any future Agreement must include the abolition of the anti-democratic backstop. We have also been clear that we will need changes to the Political Declaration, to clarify that our future relationship with the EU will be based on a Free Trade Agreement, and giving us full control over our regulations, our trade, and our foreign and defence policy. This clarity has brought benefits. Far from jeopardising negotiations, it is making them more straightforward. In the last few weeks, I believe the chances of a deal have risen. This week we are intensifying the pace of meetings in Brussels. Our European friends can see that we want an agreement. And they are beginning to reflect that reality in their response. President Macron said if, I quote, Mr. Speaker, they don’t want to hear the words of our counterparts across the Channel, they don’t want to hear about any progress that we might be making, they don’t. Mr Speaker, I think they are wilfully closing their ears to the reality that our friends and partners are increasingly seeing the possibilities of an agreement and again I quote President Macron of France: “If there are things which, as part of what was negotiated by Michel Barnier, can be adapted and are in keeping with the two objectives I’ve just mentioned – stability in Ireland which we all support and the integrity of the single market – we should identify them in the coming months.” [Political content removed] And speaking in Berlin of possible alternatives to the backstop, Chancellor Merkel of Germany said: “Once we see and say this could be a possible outcome, this could be a possible arrangement, this backstop is a sort of placeholder which is no longer necessary”, she said. [Political content removed]. I believe there are indeed solutions. [Political content removed] There are practical arrangements that we can find which avoid anyone putting infrastructure on the Irish border. These have been well worked out and involve measures such as trusted trader schemes, transit provisions, frontier zones, reduced bureaucracy for small and local traders, and many others. In particular, we recognise and I advise the Members opposite to pay attention to what is being said. We recognise that for reasons of geography and economics, agrifood is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland. We are ready to find ways forward that recognise this reality, provided it clearly enjoys the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest. We will also be discussing all this with the EU shortly and I will be discussing it with the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, when I see him in Dublin on Monday. Mr Speaker, it is simply wrong to say we are not making progress.  There is a lot to do in the coming days.  But things are moving. A major reason for that is that everyone can see this government is utterly determined to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may, without a deal if necessary. And that is why over the summer my RH Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been leading the government’s efforts, seven days a week, to accelerate our national preparations for this possibility. And he will be making a statement on that subject shortly. My RH Friend the Chancellor has made all the necessary funds available. We have already reached agreements with our partners to roll over trade deals worth around £89 billion of exports and imports. We have secured air services agreements around the world. We have increased the capacity of our Border Force, strengthened the resilience of our ports, bolstered our freight capacity, and worked with meticulous detail to ensure the uninterrupted supply of critical goods, including medicines. We will be ready, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I returned from the G7 with real momentum in the Brexit discussions. Mr Speaker, I want to return from next month’s European Council in a similar way, with a deal that this House can debate and scrutinise and endorse in time for our departure on October 31st. But Mr Speaker, there is one step that would jeopardise all the progress that we have made at the G7 and around the capitals of Europe. And that is if this House were to decide that it was simply impossible for us to leave without a deal. And to make that step illegal. That’s what they want, to force us to beg for yet another pointless delay. If that happens, all the progress that we have been making will have been for nothing. Yesterday Mr Speaker, a Bill was published – a Bill that the leader of the Opposition has spent all summer working on. This is not a Bill in any normal sense of the word. It is without precedent in our history – it is a Bill that, if passed, would force me to go to Brussels and beg an extension. It would force me to accept any terms offered. It would destroy any chance of negotiations or a new deal. And indeed it would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation, that is what it does. [Political content removed] It means running up the white flag. I want to make clear to everybody in this House – there are no circumstances in which I will ever accept anything like it. [Political content removed] Mr Speaker, we promised the people we would get Brexit done. We promised to respect the result of the referendum and we must do so now. Enough is enough. This country wants this done. They want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and though I am confident of getting a deal we will leave on 31 October in all circumstances. There will be no further pointless delay. This House has never before voted to force the Prime Minister to surrender such a crucial decision to the discretion of our friends and neighbours overseas. What is this bill would mean is that unless we agree to the terms of our friends and partners they would be able to keep us in the EU for as long as they want and on their terms. I urge therefore this House to reject this Bill tonight so that we can get the right deal for our country, deliver Brexit and take the whole country forward. And I commend this statement to the House. 

Boris:


Five weeks ago I spoke to you from these steps and said that this Government was not going to hang around and that we would not wait until brexit day - October 31 - to deliver on the priorities of the British people. And so I am proud to say that on Wednesday Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade. I said I wanted to make your streets safer - and that is why we are recruiting another 20,000 police officers. I said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce the waiting times at your GP. And so we are doing 20 new hospital upgrades in addition to the extra £34 billion going into the NHS. And I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that’s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools. And it is to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen’s speech in October. While leaving due time to debate brexit and other matters. And as we come to that brexit deadline I am encouraged by the progress we are making. In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons. They can see that we want a deal. They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has perhaps not always been the case. And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may But if there is one thing that can hold us back in these talks it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum [Political content removed] I don’t think they will. I hope that they won’t But if they do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible [Political content removed] I want everybody to know – there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts. We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise And in the meantime let our negotiators get on with their work Without that sword of Damocles over their necks And without an election, which I don’t want and you don’t want Let us get on with the people’s agenda - fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom With infrastructure education and technology It is a massive agenda. Let’s come together and get it done - and let’s get Brexit done by October 31. 

Boris:


I’d like to thank President Macron for an incredibly stylish and highly effective Summit that he’s just hosted for us here in Biarritz. Every conversation that I’ve had with my fellow leaders, I’ve been struck by their enthusiasm to expand and strengthen their relations with our country – whether that’s on trade or security or defence, science and indeed the growing opportunities we’ve had to collaborate in space and technology. We’ve also spoken in Biarritz about the biggest global challenges confronting us all today and these are things that I think very much matter to the people in the UK. We’ve been talking about biodiversity. We’ve got to stop the tragic loss of habitats and species that is happening around the world. We can’t just sit back as animals and plants are wiped off the face of the planet. The world’s animal populations have declined by about 60% in the last fifty years – about a million species are now facing extinction. And we’ve seen in the Amazon rainforest the tragic increase in fires which are made more likely by deforestation. And that’s why today I’ve announce £10 million in new funding to protect and restore the rainforest in Brazil. With one million birds and 100,000 mammals losing their lives every year from eating or getting tangled in ocean plastic – we’ve got to do much more to protect the oceans, and today I’ve announced £7 million for the Blue Belt programme to extend our work to protect the vital marine ecosystems in conservation areas in overseas territories. And don’t forget Britain has the fifth biggest marine estate in the world. If we don’t act now our children and our grandchildren will never know a world with the Great Barrier Reef, or the Sumatran Tiger or the Black Rhino. And so next year at the biodiversity COP – the Summit in China – the so called aichi targets must, in our view, be replaced with new, more ambitious targets to help us get back the biodiversity that this planet is losing, and has lost. And I’m pleased that the G7 Summit today in Biarritz has accepted those UK ideas, those proposals for biodiversity targets, for humanity to set targets to stop the reduction of habitats and species. And obviously we are going to follow up on that at the COP Summit in the UK if we’re lucky enough to get that and I very much believe that we will. There’s one issue underpinning all that which I believe holds the key to tackling so many global problems and that is the vital importance of educating girls and I’m very pleased that here at the G7 people, everybody, every delegation has supported the UK’s campaign to give every girl in the world 12 years of quality education. Today I announced funding to give 600,000 children in the world’s most dangerous countries, where girls are twice as likely as boys to be out of school, the opportunity to go to school for the first time. We discussed Iran, and we are all agreed that Iran should never under any circumstances be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. And there is clearly an opportunity for Iran to now come back into compliance with a nuclear deal – the JCPOA – and to resume dialogue as well as to cease its disruptive behaviour in the region. We expressed, collectively, deep concern about what is happening in Hong Kong, and the G7 nations all want to support a stable and a prosperous Hong Kong. And we remain collectively committed to the one country two systems framework. And I was pleased that was reflected in the conclusions of the Summit, which was as I say very productive indeed. People can quarrel with Summits and with world leaders coming together in this way for discussions about the wide ranging issues we have had – but I really think that if the leaders who have been gathered together in Biarritz over the last couple of days really follow through on these discussions, and really mean what they say in the conclusions, I think it will make a real difference to the issues that the people in our country care very deeply about. So I thank you very much for sticking with it. I know it’s been a long old Summit, but I’d like to take your questions now. 

Boris:


Good morning everyone and thank you for joining me here in Manchester – in the heart of the world’s first industrial city. A city whose confidence and whose extraordinary future we can see in the changing fabric of the urban landscape, the mighty towers of Deansgate Square, last week’s extraordinary International Festival in Manchester. We can see it in the Christie, the hospital where the future of cancer treatment will be written at the vast new Paterson building, with new therapies saving the lives of people around the world for generations to come. This is not and has never been a city for negativity or navel-gazing. Indeed when the University of Manchester’s Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov said they were planning to extract a single-atom-thick crystallites from bulk graphite - I hope I’ve got that right - to give us the super-light super-strong wonder that is Graphene… I imagine that there were people who had no idea what difference it could make to their lives - and frankly people in this audience who have no idea, Yet today, we stand on the cusp of the Graphene age, with applications in everything from de-icing of aircraft wings to life-saving medicine. Their story of those pioneers is told here at the Science and Industry Museum, and it is one of the countless tales of Mancunian pioneers. Because time and again, when the cynics say something cannot be done - Mancunians find a way to get on and do it. And the centre of Manchester – like the centre of London – is a wonder of the world. But just a few miles away from here the story is very different. Towns with famous names, proud histories, fine civic buildings where unfortunately the stereotypical story of the last few decades has been long term decline. Endemic health problems. Generational unemployment. Down-at-heel high streets. The story has been, for young people growing up there of hopelessness, or the hope that one day they’ll get out and never come back. And in so far as that story is true and sometimes it is, the crucial point is it isn’t really the fault of the places and it certainly isn’t the fault of the people growing up there - they haven’t failed. No, it is we, us the politicians, the politics, that has failed. Time and again they have voted for change, but for too long politicians have failed to deliver on what is needed. Our plan now, this new Government I am leading, is to unite our country and level up. And I want to explain now what I mean by that. Now I am absolutely not here to tell you, Mr Mayor, that London has all the answers. Or that everywhere should be like London, or indeed like Manchester. Each place in our country has a unique heritage, a unique character, and a unique future. And indeed I recognise that when the British people voted to leave the European Union, they were not just voting against Brussels – they were voting against London too, and against all concentrations of power in remote centres. So I’m not here to say that Manchester or London are the template for other places. But I do believe there are lessons to be learnt from the success of cities like these. I remember London in the 1970s - how it was stuck in post-war gloom and doom. Between 1951 and 1981 the population actually declined - it went down 20 per cent it was so miserable. Yet, over the last twenty years, the capital of our country has been utterly transformed. London is today one of the world’s leading global cities (second only to Manchester!) - with the largest concentration of tech companies, artists, financial services, top class restaurants and all the rest of it. We can see the same thing happening now in this incredible city. So today I want to set out what I think are the basic ingredients of success for the UK, and for the places we call home: our cities or our towns, our coastal communities and rural areas. There are four things I think we need to get right. First is basic liveability. The streets need to be safe. There need to be enough affordable homes. There need to be jobs that pay good wages. There need to be great public services supporting families and helping the most vulnerable. Second thing - connections. That means great broadband everywhere, and it means transport. Inspiration and innovation, cross fertilisation between people, literally and figuratively, cannot take place unless people can bump into each other, compete collaborate invent and innovate. We need to literally and spiritually unite Britain, and that means boosting growth and bringing our regions together. The third thing that places need is culture. People love Manchester because of the fantastic arts and entertainment here, the football and music, the heritage and the creative industries that make it such a lively, wonderful place to live and work. We need to help places everywhere to strengthen their cultural and creative infrastructure, the gathering places that give a community its life. And finally, the fourth thing - places need power and a sense of responsibility, accountability. Taking back control doesn’t just apply to Westminster regaining sovereignty from the EU. It means our cities and counties and towns becoming more self-governing. It means people taking more responsibility for their own communities. London and Manchester have boomed partly because they have had Mayors – some better than others, I would say, but all with the power to speak for their cities, to bang heads together, to get things done. These are the lessons from London and Manchester. Liveability. Connectivity. Culture. And power. And the first condition of liveability is of course making our streets safer. Because recorded crime here in the North West is up 42 per cent. I think it’s time we got that down, and we will. Yesterday I met twenty new officers in Birmingham who are graduating after 15 weeks training. They will now join our brave and formidable police men and women who will be putting their lives on the line for our safety. But you want more of these policemen and women on our streets – and so do I. That is why I have committed to an extra 20,000 police officers over the next three years. Their recruitment will begin in earnest within weeks. And a new national policing board chaired by our dynamic new Home Secretary will hold the police to account for meeting this target. We will also give the police greater ability to use stop and search in order to drive a reduction in the violent crime that plagues our communities. But there is no point in arresting, charging and convicting criminals if we do not then give them the sentences they deserve. In fact the number of offenders with more than 50 previous convictions who were convicted but spared jail rose from 1,299 in 2007 to 3,196 in 2018. So we need to restore the public’s faith in our criminal justice system, by ensuring that people who repeatedly commit crimes are punished properly, and that means those that are guilty of the most serious violent and sexual offences are required to serve a custodial sentence that reflects the severity of their offence. And it is only by making the streets safer than you can create the neighbourhoods that people want to live. One of the biggest divides in our country is between those who can afford their own home and those who cannot. This is a long-term problem which all governments have failed to fix. So we will review everything - including planning regulations, stamp duty, housing zones, as well as the efficacy of existing Government initiatives. And, we will also emphasise the need, the duty, to build beautiful homes that people actually want to live in, and being sensitive to local concerns. And then of course to get great, great neighbourhoods, safe streets, allow people to own their own homes - we need great public services to make that possible. Which is why I have committed to delivering the funding promised to the NHS by the previous government in June 2018 and to ensure this vital money goes to frontline services as soon as possible. This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter readiness. And proposals drastically to reduce waiting times for GP appointments. The NHS represents a sacred promise between the state and its citizens. A promise that says we will protect and support one another when we are at our most vulnerable and weakest. And the same should go for the other great service of wellbeing; particularly social care. Yet many people who have worked hard all their lives have had to struggle with the financial burden of care in their final years and been forced to sell their homes. The British people cannot understand why the health service is able to provide the same care for everyone, regardless of income, And yet the social care system cripples those with savings. For too long, I think politicians have simply kicked this can down the road. I want you to know, that can-kicking stops now. So I have promised to find a long term solution to social care once and for all. And that is what we will do - with a clear plan that will give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. At the same time, we will give every child the world class education they deserve. Which is why we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this parliament. And we cannot afford any longer the chronic under-funding of our brilliant FE colleges, which do so much to support young people’s skills and our economy. We have a world class university sector; in fact it is one of the biggest concentrations of higher education anywhere in Europe right here in this city - why should we not aspire to the same status for our further education institutions, to allow people to express their talents? If you’re going to allow people to express their talents properly, then you need proper connectivity. It is absolutely crucial. Because if you are someone with a bright idea, or you are running a fantastic business, but you can’t get the connectivity you need and instead spend an eternity staring at that pizza wheel circle of doom on your computer screen – then you won’t be able to get your idea off the ground, you won’t be able to grow your business, and you won’t be able to find customers. And you can have all the talent in the world but if you are a young kid in a deprived town, with intermittent transport, and you can’t get to the places where the jobs are then you won’t have the opportunities you deserve. But people are able to meet each other, and compete with each other, challenge each other,  spark off each other - around the water cooler or elsewhere - That’s when we get the explosion, or flash of creativity and innovation. That is what we are going to make that happen - not just here but across the country. First we’re going to invest in fibre roll-out and indeed we have just completed the build of a large fibre cable between Manchester and York alongside the Trans-Pennine railway route. This interconnects the Manchester and Leeds Internet Exchanges and strengthens the internet infrastructure for the Northern Powerhouse. I am delighted to see Jake Berry, sitting in the Cabinet, expressing this Government’s commitment to the Northern Powerhouse. And just now, before coming here, I met Barry White - at the Pomona site - part of a huge stretch of new tramline that will link up to Northern Powerhouse Rail. I want to be the Prime Minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London. And today I am going to deliver on my commitment to that vision with a pledge to fund the Leeds to Manchester route. I want to stress it will be up to local people to decide what comes next, as far as I’m concerned that’s just the beginning of our commitment and our investment. We want to see this whole thing run. I have tasked officials to accelerate their work on these plans so that we are ready to do a deal in the autumn. It is the right thing to do, it’s time we put some substance into the idea of the Northern Powerhouse Rail, and that’s why we are here this morning. We want to inject some pace into this so that we can unlock jobs and boost growth. But I know people can’t wait and they want to see change faster.  They want change now. It takes a while to build a railway, believe me. They want reliable, everyday services – so that the 18-year-old in Rochdale just starting out as an apprentice knows that they can get into Manchester for 8 o’clock each morning. So that people can get out and about in the evening, for a drink and a meal – boosting local businesses and growth. Services within cities, not just between cities. Services that mean people don’t have to drive. Services that don’t just give up at the end of the working day. So I am going to improve - with your help - the local services which people use every day. And I want that to start now with improvements that can happen in the short term. That means buses. I know a lot about buses, believe me. I love buses. I helped to invent a new type of bus, very beautiful that it is. I will begin as a matter of urgency the transformation of local bus services – starting here today in Manchester. I will work with the Mayor of Greater Manchester on his plans to deliver a London style bus system in the area under powers we gave to him - you Andy - in the Bus Services Act. I want higher frequency, low-emission or zero-emission buses, more bus priority corridors, a network that’s easier to understand and use. I want local partnerships between the private sector, which operates the buses, and a public body, which coordinates them. In London – where they have all these things – bus passenger journeys have risen by 97 per cent in 25 years. In other metropolitan areas – where they do not – it has fallen by 34 per cent over the same period. I think we can see the first results, here in Greater Manchester, within a few months. And I want the same for any other part of the country where local leaders want to do it. Good bus connections, good transport connectivity, is also vital to so many of the towns that feel left behind. We are also going to start answering the pleas of some of our left behind towns, And this might come as a surprise to some, but not everyone wants to live in one of our country’s great cities. Too many places - towns and coastal communities - that don’t feel they are getting benefits from the grown we are seeing elsewhere in the UK economy. Now I reject the ridiculous idea that everybody’s ambition is to get on their bikes and move to the city. Our post-industrial towns have a proud, great heritage - but an even greater future. Their best years lie ahead of them. So we are going to put proper money into the places that need it. We will start by ensuring there is investment from central government – by bringing forward plans on the UK Shared Prosperity Fund - and we have growth deals as well for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And we’re now going to have a £3.6 billion Towns Fund supporting an initial 100 towns. So that they will get the improved transport and improved broadband connectivity that they need. They’ll also get help with that vital social and cultural infrastructure, from libraries and art centres to parks and youth services: the institutions that bring communities together, and give places new energy and new life. Finally, of course, there is an even more radical shift that we need to make now to deliver this and I have seen myself the changes that you can bring about in towns and cities and regions, when local people have more of a say over their own destinies. A say over their own destinies. And I do not believe that, when the people of the United Kingdom voted to take back control, they did so in order for that control to be hoarded in Westminster. So we are going to give greater powers to council leaders and to communities. We are going to level up the powers offered to mayors so that more people can benefit from the kind of local government structures seen in London and here in Manchester. We are going to give more communities a greater say over changes to transport, housing, public services and infrastructure that will benefit their areas and drive local growth. And in doing so, we will see to it that every part of this country sees the benefits of the potentially massive opportunity that will come from Brexit. Over the last three years, we have tended to treat Brexit like some impending adverse weather event. I campaigned to leave the EU because I believed it was a chance to change the direction of the UK and make us the best country in the world to live. Leaving the EU is a massive economic opportunity - to do the things we’ve not been allowed to do for decades, to rid ourselves of bureaucratic red tape, create jobs, untangle the creativity and innovation for which Britain is famous. And we do not need to wait to start preparing to seize the benefits of that project. So we will begin right away to create the free ports that will generate thousands of high-skilled jobs - and revitalise some of the poorest parts of our country. We will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research We will double down on our investment in R&amp;D, we will accelerate the talks on those free trade deals And prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in Europe for overseas investment. At the same time we will unite and level up across our country - as I say, with infrastructure, better education and with technology. And in so doing, making our whole nation not just an alright kind of place to live, or a better-than-average place to live but the greatest place on earth. The greatest place to live, to raise a family, to send your kids to school, a great place to start a business, to invest and to have a life - And where better than Manchester, where better than the Science and Industry Museum, to set out our ambition for doing so. Here today we can look back at centuries of progress, the inventions, ideas and breakthroughs that came out of Manchester, came out of the North, came out of the United Kingdom and shaped the world we know today. I just want you to imagine, if we were to reconvene here 30, 40, 50 or more years hence, what treasures this museum might hold then. I’m absolutely certain there will be displays celebrating the dawn of a new age of electric vehicles, not just cars or buses, but electric planes, made possible with battery technology being developed now in the UK. You will see tributes and dioramas commemorating the men and women who use new gene therapies to cure the incurable and achieve the impossible. Here in Manchester, home of the world’s first passenger railway, with Stephenson’s rocket behind me, we should remember that there were people back then who thought that the whole project should be abandoned as a danger to public health, because the speeds that were being proposed would be intolerable for the human body. So I can imagine in the future of this wonderful museum there will exhibits recording not only the breakthroughs in bioscience, here in Manchester and elsewhere that allow the UK to lead the world in producing genetically modified crops - blight-resistance potatoes will feed the world. But also a memorial to the sceptics and doubters, complete with bioengineered edible paper, with which they were forced to eat their words. I don’t blame the doubters and the sceptics, but all I will say, is that the evidence is behind us, there’s Stephenson’s rocket behind us, we’re sending rockets into space - we will expand our space programme as well. I don’t blame the doubters and the sceptics, it’s a natural human instinct, but time and again, they have been proved wrong. I think they will be proved wrong again. If we unite our country, with better education, better infrastructure, with an emphasis on new technology, then this really can be a new golden age for the UK. Time and again Manchester has shown the UK that anything is possible. Time and again this extraordinary country has delivered the same message to the world. That’s what we are going to do once more. 

Boris:


Mr Speaker, I with permission, shall make a statement on the mission of this new Conservative Government. But before I begin, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Maidenhead - for all that she has given in the service of our nation. From fighting modern slavery to tackling the problems of mental ill-health – she has a great legacy on which we shall all be proud to build. And our mission is to deliver Brexit on the 31st of October for the purpose of uniting and re-energising our great United Kingdom and making this country the greatest place on earth. And when I say the greatest place on earth, I’m conscious that some may accuse me of hyperbole. But it is useful to imagine the trajectory on which we could now be embarked. By 2050 it is more than possible that the United Kingdom will be the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe – at the centre of a new network of trade deals that we have pioneered. With the road and rail investments we are making and propose to make now – the investment in broadband and 5G – our country will boast the most formidable transport and technological connectivity on the planet. By unleashing the productive power of the whole United Kingdom - not just of London and the South East but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – we will have closed forever the productivity gap and seen to it that no town is left behind ever again; no community ever again forgotten. Our children and grandchildren will be living longer, happier, healthier, wealthier lives. Our United Kingdom of 2050 will no longer make any contribution whatsoever to the destruction of our precious planet brought about by carbon emissions – because we will have led the world in delivering that net zero target. We will be the home of electric vehicles – cars, even planes, powered by British made battery technology being developed right here, right now. We will have the freeports to revitalise our coastal communities, a bioscience sector liberated from anti genetic modification rules, blight-resistant crops that will feed the world - and the satellite and earth observation systems that are the envy of the world. We will be the seedbed for the most exciting and most dynamic business investments on the planet. Our Constitutional settlement, our United Kingdom will be firm, will be secure. Our Union of nations beyond question. Our democracy robust. Our future clean, green, prosperous, united, confident, ambitious – this my friends is the prize, more still the responsibility that it falls on us to fulfil. And to do so, we must take some immediate steps. The first is to restore trust in our democracy and fulfil the repeated promises of Parliament to the people by coming out of the European Union – and doing so on October 31st. I and all ministers in this government are committed to leaving on this date, whatever the circumstances. To do otherwise would cause a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system. It will leave the British people wondering whether their politicians could ever be trusted again to follow a clear democratic instruction. I would prefer us to leave the EU with a deal. I would much prefer it. I believe that is still possible even at this late stage and I will work flat out to make it happen. But certain things need to be clear. The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by my predecessor has been three times rejected by this House.  Its terms are unacceptable to this Parliament and to this country.  No country that values its independence and indeed its self-respect could agree to a Treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does. A time limit is not enough.  If an agreement is to be reached it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. For our part we are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. I do not accept the argument that says that these issues can only be solved by all or part of the UK remaining in the customs union or in the single market. The evidence is that other arrangements are perfectly possible, and are also perfectly compatible with the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement, to which we are of course steadfastly committed. I, my team, and my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union are ready to meet and to talk on this basis to the Commission or other EU colleagues whenever they are ready to do so. For our part, we will throw ourselves into these negotiations with the greatest energy and determination and in the spirit of friendship. And I hope that the EU will be equally ready and that they will rethink their current refusal to make any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. If they do not, we will of course have to leave the EU without an agreement under Article 50. The UK is better prepared for that situation than many believe. But we are not as ready yet as we should be. In the 98 days that remain to us we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible to our national life. I believe that is possible with the kind of national effort that the British people have made before and will make again. In these circumstances we would, of course, also have available the £39bn in the Withdrawal Agreement to help deal with any consequences. I have today instructed the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to make these preparations his top priority. I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to mobilise the Civil Service to deliver this outcome should it become necessary. And the Chancellor has confirmed that all necessary funding will be made available. I will also ensure that preparing for leaving the EU without an agreement under Article 50 is not just about seeking to mitigate the challenges but also about grasping the opportunities. This is not just about technical preparations, vital though they are. It is about having a clear economic strategy for the UK in all scenarios, something which the Conservative Party has always led the way, and it’s about producing policies which will boost the competitiveness and the productivity of our economy when we are free of the EU regulations. Indeed, Mr Speaker, we will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research. And we will be now accelerating the talks on those free trade deals. And we will prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment. A status that is made possible by the diversity talent and skills of our workforce and, Mr Speaker, I also want therefore to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 million EU nationals now living and working among us. I thank them for their contribution to our society – and for their patience - and I can assure them that under this government they will have the absolute certainty of the right to live and remain. Mr Speaker, I want to end by making clear that my commitment to the 31 October date for our exit. Our national participation in the European Union is coming to an end. This reality needs to be recognised by all parties. Indeed, Mr Speaker today there are very many brilliant officials trapped in meeting after meeting in Brussels and Luxembourg when they could be better deploying their talents in preparing to pioneer new trade deals and promoting a truly Global Britain. I want to start unshackling our officials to undertake this new mission right away. So we will not nominate a UK Commissioner for the new Commission taking office on 1 November – though clearly this is not intended to stop the EU appointing a new commission. Mr Speaker, today is the first day of a new approach, which will end with our exit from the EU on 31 October.  Then I hope we can have a friendly and constructive relationship – as constitutional equals, as friends, and partners in facing the challenges that lie ahead.  I believe that is possible and this government will work to make it so. But Mr Speaker, we are not going to wait until 31st October to begin building the broader and bolder future that I have described. We are going to start right away, providing vital funding for our frontline public services, to deliver better healthcare, better education and more police on the streets. Mr Speaker, I am committed to making sure that the NHS receives the funds that were promised by the last government in June 2018 and that these funds go to frontline as soon as possible. This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness. I have asked officials to provide policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments. To address the rise of violent crime in our country I have announced that there will be 20,000 extra police keeping us safe over the next three years, and I have asked my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary to ensure this is treated as an absolute priority. We will give greater powers for the police to use stop and search to help tackle violent crime. I have also tasked officials to draw up proposals to ensure that in future those found guilty of the most serious sexual and violent offences are required to serve a custodial sentence that truly reflects the severity of their offence and policy measures that will see a reduction in the number of prolific offenders. On education, I have listened to the concerns of many colleagues and we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this Parliament. We are committed to levelling up across every nation and region across the UK, providing support to towns and cities and closing the opportunity gap in our society. We will announce investment in vital infrastructure, fibre rollout, transport and housing that can improve people’s quality of life, fuel economic growth and provide opportunity. Finally, we will also ensure that we continue to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world. No-one believes more strongly than me in the benefits of migration to our country. But I am clear that our immigration system must change. For years, politicians have promised the public an Australian-style points based system. And today I will actually deliver on those promises - I will ask the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review of that system as the first step in a radical rewriting of our immigration system. I am convinced that we can produce a system that the British public can have confidence in. Mr Speaker, over these past few years, too many people in this country feel that they have been told repeatedly and relentlessly what we cannot do. Since I was a child I remember respectable authorities asserting that our time as a nation has passed, that we should be content with mediocrity and managed decline. And time and again – even the sceptics and doubters - by their powers to innovate and adapt the British people have showed the doubters wrong. And Mr Speaker I believe that at this pivotal moment in our national story we are going to prove the doubters wrong again. Not just with positive thinking and a can-do attitude, important though they are. But with the help and the encouragement government and a Cabinet that is bursting with ideas, ready to create change, determined to implement the policies we need to succeed as a nation. The greatest place to live The greatest place to bring up a family The greatest place to send your kids to school The greatest place to set up a business or to invest Because we have the best transport and the cleanest environment and the best healthcare, And the most compassionate approach to care of elderly people. That is the mission of the Cabinet I have appointed. That is the purpose of the government I am leading. And that is why I believe that if we bend our sinews to the task now, There is every chance that in 2050, When I fully intend to be around, though not necessarily in this job we will look back on this period, this extraordinary period, as the beginning of a new golden age for our United Kingdom. And I commend this future to the House just as much as I commend this statement. 

Boris:


Good afternoon I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen who has invited me to form a government and I have accepted I pay tribute to the fortitude and patience of my predecessor and her deep sense of public service but in spite of all her efforts it has become clear that there are pessimists at home and abroad who think that after three years of indecision that this country has become a prisoner to the old arguments of 2016 and that in this home of democracy we are incapable of honouring a basic democratic mandate And so I am standing before you today to tell you the British people that those critics are wrong The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters – they are going to get it wrong again The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we are going to restore trust in our democracy and we are going to fulfil the repeated promises of parliament to the people and come out of the EU on October 31 no ifs or buts and we will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities of Brexit while allowing us to develop a new and exciting partnership with the rest of Europe based on free trade and mutual support I have every confidence that in 99 days’ time we will have cracked it but you know what – we aren’t going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting The time has come to act, to take decisions to give strong leadership and to change this country for the better and though the Queen has just honoured me with this extraordinary office of state my job is to serve you, the people because if there is one point we politicians need to remember it is that the people are our bosses My job is to make your streets safer – and we are going to begin with another 20,000 police on the streets and we start recruiting forthwith My job is to make sure you don’t have to wait 3 weeks to see your GP and we start work this week with 20 new hospital upgrades, and ensuring that money for the NHS really does get to the front line My job is to protect you or your parents or grandparents from the fear of having to sell your home to pay for the costs of care and so I am announcing now – on the steps of Downing Street – that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve My job is to make sure your kids get a superb education wherever they are in the country and that’s why we have already announced that we are going to level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and that is the work that begins immediately behind that black door and though I am today building a great team of men and women I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see Never mind the backstop – the buck stops here And I will tell you something else about my job. It is to be Prime Minister of the whole United Kingdom and that means uniting our country answering at last the plea of the forgotten people and the left behind towns by physically and literally renewing the ties that bind us together so that with safer streets and better education and fantastic new road and rail infrastructure and full fibre broadband we level up across Britain with higher wages, and a higher living wage, and higher productivity we close the opportunity gap giving millions of young people the chance to own their own homes and giving business the confidence to invest across the UK because it is time we unleashed the productive power not just of London and the South East but of every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red white and blue flag who together are so much more than the sum of their parts and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world for our inventiveness, for our humour, for our universities, our scientists, our armed forces, our diplomacy for the equalities on which we insist – whether race or gender or LGBT or the right of every girl in the world to 12 years of quality education and for the values we stand for around the world Everyone knows the values that flag represents It stands for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law and above all it stands for democracy and that is why we will come out of the EU on October 31 because in the end Brexit was a fundamental decision by the British people that they wanted their laws made by people that they can elect and they can remove from office and we must now respect that decision and create a new partnership with our European friends –  as warm and as close and as affectionate as possible and the first step is to repeat unequivocally our guarantee to the 3.2 m EU nationals now living and working among us and I say directly to you – thank you for your contribution to our society thank you for your patience and I can assure you that under this government you will get the  absolute certainty of the rights to live and remain And next I say to our friends in Ireland, and in Brussels and around the EU I am convinced that we can do a deal without checks at the Irish border, because we refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop and it is of course vital at the same time that we prepare for the remote possibility that Brussels refuses any further to negotiate and we are forced to come out with no deal not because we want that outcome – of course not but because it is only common sense to prepare and let me stress that there is a vital sense in which those preparations cannot be wasted and that is because under any circumstances we will need to get ready at some point in the near future to come out of the EU customs union and out of regulatory control fully determined at last to take advantage of brexit because that is the course on which this country is now set with high hearts and growing confidence we will now accelerate the work of getting ready and the ports will be ready and the banks will be ready and the factories will be ready and business will be ready and the hospitals will be ready and our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more not just here but around the world and don’t forget that in the event of a no deal outcome we will have the extra lubrication of the £39 bn and whatever deal we do we will prepare this autumn for an economic package to boost British business and to lengthen this country’s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment and to all those who continue to prophesy disaster I say yes – there will be difficulties though I believe that with energy and application they will be far less serious than some have claimed but if there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business over the last three years it is not the decisions we have taken it is our refusal to take decisions and to all those who say we cannot be ready I say do not underestimate this country Do not underestimate our powers of organisation and our determination because we know the enormous strengths of this economy in life sciences, in tech, in academia, in music, the arts, culture, financial services, It is here in Britain that we are using gene therapy, for the first time, to treat the most common form of blindness here in Britain that we are leading the world in the battery technology that will help cut CO2 and tackle climate change and produce green jobs for the next generation and as we prepare for a post-Brexit future it is time we looked not at the risks but at the opportunities that are upon us so let us begin work now to create freeports that will drive growth and thousands of high-skilled jobs in left behind areas let’s start now to liberate the UK’s extraordinary bioscience sector from anti genetic modification rules and let’s develop the blight-resistant crops that will feed the world let’s get going now on our own position navigation and timing satellite and earth observation systems – UK assets orbiting in space with all the long term strategic and commercial benefits for this country Let’s change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research and let’s promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people and yes, let’s start now on those free trade deals because it is free trade that has done more than anything else to lift billions out of poverty all this and more we can do now and only now, at this extraordinary moment in our history and after three years of unfounded self-doubt it is time to change the record to recover our natural and historic role as an enterprising, outward-looking and truly global Britain, generous in temper and engaged with the world No one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country They will not succeed today We in this government will work flat out to give this country the leadership it deserves and that work begins now Thank you very much
